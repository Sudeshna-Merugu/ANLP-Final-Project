"This paper investigates the effectiveness of three different information allocation policies - elitism, egalitarianism, and welfarism - in improving the performance of task-oriented groups. Through a series of experiments with human participants, we found that both elitism and egalitarianism outperform welfarism in terms of group performance.

These findings suggest that policies that prioritize individual performance, rather than need, are more effective in task-oriented groups. Our results have practical implications for organizations seeking to improve their team performance and for policymakers designing information allocation policies in group contexts.",This paper looks at how well three different ways of allocating information work to improve performance by teams that work on specific tasks.

Practical benefits can be drawn from this research for both companies hoping to enhance team performance and government officials creating policies for group settings.
"This paper presents a parallel algorithm for weighted random sampling of large datasets. Weighted random sampling is a common operation in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data mining, where samples are drawn from a dataset in proportion to their weights.

"This paper investigates the use of graph-based link prediction methods for predicting the relationships between human phenotypes and genes. Human phenotypes are the observable physical or biochemical traits of an individual, while genes are the genetic information responsible for these traits. The relationship between phenotypes and genes is often complex and difficult to predict, and improving our understanding of this relationship can provide valuable insights into the development and treatment of genetic diseases. In this study, a heterogeneous graph is constructed using data from publicly available databases, including gene-phenotype associations and protein-protein interactions. Various graph-based link prediction methods are applied to this graph to predict novel relationships between phenotypes and genes. These methods include node similarity-based methods, path-based methods, and matrix factorization-based methods. The performance of the different link prediction methods is evaluated using cross-validation and other standard evaluation metrics. The results show that the graph-based link prediction methods are effective at predicting novel relationships between phenotypes and genes, and that the performance of the methods can be improved by combining multiple methods. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of graph-based link prediction methods for predicting relationships between human phenotypes and genes, and provides a useful framework for further research in this area.

"This paper investigates the problem of video object segmentation, which involves accurately segmenting an object of interest from a video sequence. Specifically, we propose a novel method that associates objects with transformers, a type of neural network architecture commonly used in natural language processing tasks. Our method utilizes a two-stage approach. First, we use a traditional object detection algorithm to identify objects in the video frames. We then associate each object with a transformer network, which learns to encode the object's appearance and motion information over time. The transformer network generates a feature embedding for each object, which is used as input to a fully convolutional network to generate per-pixel segmentation masks. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and compare it against state-of-the-art methods.

"The tractability of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) has been an important topic of study in theoretical computer science for several decades. In this paper, we investigate the tractability of CSPs that can be defined by forbidden patterns. We first introduce the notion of a forbidden pattern, which is a small set of constraints that cannot appear together in any solution to a CSP. We then define a class of CSPs based on forbidden patterns and investigate their computational complexity. We show that certain classes of CSPs defined by forbidden patterns are tractable, while others are NP-hard. In particular, we identify a large class of CSPs that are polynomial-time solvable, even when the number of variables is unbounded. We also show that the complexity of a CSP defined by forbidden patterns is closely related to the structure of the forbidden patterns themselves. Our results have important implications for the design and analysis of algorithms for solving CSPs. They suggest that the structure of the forbidden patterns in a CSP can be used to guide the development of efficient algorithms. They also provide insight into the kinds of patterns that make CSPs hard to solve, which could inform the design of benchmarks for evaluating the performance of CSP solvers.","A long time ago, people have studied how easy or hard it is to solve Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). This paper looks at CSPs whose solutions must avoid specific sets of constraints called forbidden patterns. We start by defining forbidden patterns as small groups of constraints that cannot be used together.

Particularly we find that a big class of CSPs becomes easy to solve efficiently even if the number of variables is very large. We also find there is a close connection between how hard a CSP is to solve and what forbidden patterns are used. Results from our work are important for designing algorithms for solving CSPs.

They also reveal which types of forbidden patterns make CSPs hard and this can inform benchmarking design for CSP solvers."
"The embedding capacity of information flows is a critical parameter in network communication that determines the maximum amount of information that can be transmitted without error. In this paper, we investigate the embedding capacity of information flows under renewal traffic, a type of traffic pattern in which inter-arrival times between consecutive packets follow a probability distribution that may change over time. Using a theoretical framework based on queueing theory, we derive analytical expressions for the embedding capacity of different types of channels under renewal traffic. We show that the embedding capacity is strongly dependent on the statistical properties of the inter-arrival time distribution, and that it may exhibit counterintuitive behavior such as decreasing with increasing arrival rate or becoming infinite for some parameter regimes. We also investigate the effect of various system parameters such as channel capacity, noise level, and packet size on the embedding capacity. Our numerical results show that the embedding capacity may be significantly enhanced by using coding schemes that exploit the temporal structure of renewal traffic. Our research contributes to the fundamental understanding of information transmission in communication networks and provides insights into the design of efficient coding schemes for practical applications. The analytical and numerical methods developed in this paper can be used to optimize the performance of network communication systems in various scenarios, including wireless and wired networks, and the Internet of Things.","An important consideration in communication networks is the embedding capacity for information flow: this is the maximum amount of information that can be transmitted reliably. This paper investigates embedding capacity under renewal traffic, which is a kind of traffic pattern where inter arrival times of successive packets are drawn from a distribution that might vary over time. Based on queueing theory, we derive analytical expressions for different types of channels under renewal traffic.

"This paper aims to investigate the effect of heteroscedasticity on the design of linear classifiers in linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Linear discriminant analysis is a widely used statistical method for classification problems. However, it is often assumed that the variance of the predictor variables is constant across classes, which is not always the case in real-world applications. This violation of the homoscedasticity assumption can affect the performance of LDA classifiers. In this paper, we propose a modified LDA approach that accounts for heteroscedasticity by using a weighted covariance matrix in the linear discriminant function. We compare the performance of our proposed method with traditional LDA methods using simulated and real data sets under different levels of heteroscedasticity. Our simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional LDA methods when the variance of the predictor variables is not constant across classes. The proposed method also shows improved performance in the classification of real data sets with heteroscedasticity. We also provide a method to select the optimal weighting scheme to maximize the classification accuracy. Our findings suggest that accounting for heteroscedasticity is important for accurate classification in LDA, and the proposed method can be a useful tool in the design of linear classifiers in the presence of heteroscedasticity.",This paper studies how violating assumptions about equal variances affects classifiers designed using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). LDA is a common statistical method used for classification but typically assumes that variance among features is uniform across different classes. This assumption does not hold up well in practical settings. Violations of this assumption can impact classifier performance. Here we develop a new approach that uses weights based on covariance matrices to account for differing variances and compares this method with standard LDA approaches using both simulated and real data at different levels of variance differences. Results indicate that our new method performs better than standard LDA when variance varies among classes. Performance improvement is also seen for classifying real data with varying variance. A procedure is given to choose optimal weight schemes that maximize accuracy. Results point to importance of considering variance heterogeneity and suggest that this new approach is useful for designing classifiers where variance differs among features.

"Autoscaling has become a crucial feature for cloud-based services to meet the varying demands of users. However, traditional autoscaling approaches rely on pre-defined scaling rules that may not adapt well to the dynamic nature of the cloud environment. This paper presents a comparative study of two novel approaches to autoscaling: self-aware and self-adaptive autoscaling. The self-aware approach leverages machine learning techniques to predict resource demands based on historical data and the current state of the system. The self-adaptive approach, on the other hand, uses control theory to dynamically adjust the scaling rules based on real-time feedback from the system. To evaluate the effectiveness of these approaches, we conducted experiments using a cloud-based application and compared the performance of the self-aware and self-adaptive approaches with traditional autoscaling. Our results show that both self-aware and self-adaptive autoscaling outperform traditional approaches in terms of reducing response time and increasing resource utilization. Additionally, the self-adaptive approach is better suited for handling sudden spikes in demand, while the self-aware approach is more effective at predicting long-term trends in resource usage. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential benefits of self-aware and self-adaptive autoscaling for cloud-based services and provides insights into their relative strengths and weaknesses. We believe that these approaches can help cloud providers to better manage their resources, improve the quality of service for users, and reduce costs associated with over-provisioning.","Autoscaling has become important for cloud applications to meet the fluctuating demand of users. Traditionally, autoscaling relies on fixed rules which do not work well with the fluidity of cloud environments. This paper examines two new approaches to autoscaling: one that learns awareness and another that adapts. The one that learns awareness uses machine learning to forecast future demand based on past data and current system status. The adaptive one uses control theory to adjust scaling rules dynamically according to real feedback from the system. For evaluation purposes, experiments were run using an application hosted in the cloud and compared performance against traditional methods. Results indicate both awareness and adaptive autoscaling perform better than previous methods regarding response times and resource use. Adaptive scaling also works better for spikes in demand while awareness works better for long term trend prediction. This research highlights potential benefits of awareness and adaptive autoscaling for cloud services and offers insight into their advantages and disadvantages. We think that these methods could enhance management of resources for cloud providers, improve user service quality and reduce costs due to over provisioning."

"This paper presents a study of age of information (AoI) minimization for an energy harvesting source that updates erasures, both with and without feedback. AoI is a metric that measures the freshness of data being transmitted in a communication system. The study focuses on the scenario where a source has limited energy resources and must harvest energy from its environment to perform updates. The source also experiences erasures, which cause it to lose information and increase the AoI. The study compares the AoI performance of two cases: one with feedback, where the source receives information about the status of its updates, and one without feedback, where the source has no information about the status of its updates. The results of the study show that feedback can significantly improve the AoI performance of the energy harvesting source in the presence of erasures. The findings have important implications for the design of energy-efficient communication systems that must maintain fresh data.",This paper studies age of information (AoI) reduction for a device that harvests energy to update itself. Both erasures and feedback are considered. AoI is a measurement of data freshness in a communications system. This research looks at situations where the device has low energy reserves and must harvest energy from its surroundings to perform updates. Sometimes this causes loss of information and increases AoI. We compare performance against two scenarios: one with feedback where the device gets information regarding status of updates and another without feedback where there is no such information.

"This paper explores the interrelationships between generalized $q$-entropies and a generalized Fisher information. The $q$-entropies provide a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy and have found applications in fields such as statistical mechanics, information theory, and signal processing. The generalized Fisher information, on the other hand, characterizes the amount of information contained in a probability distribution about a parameter of interest. The paper establishes a Cramér-Rao inequality involving the $q$-entropies and the generalized Fisher information, which bounds the variance of any unbiased estimator of the parameter of interest in terms of the derivative of the $q$-entropy with respect to the parameter. The inequality is shown to hold for a broad class of probability distributions and can be used to derive lower bounds on the variance of any unbiased estimator. These results have implications for the design and analysis of statistical inference procedures in a variety of fields.","This paper investigates the relationship between $q$ entropies and generalized Fisher information. Entropies are related to Shannon entropy and they are widely used in areas including statistical mechanics, information theory and signal processing. Generalized Fisher information quantifies the information content regarding an important parameter. The authors prove a Cramér Rao type inequality that relates these two quantities; this inequality sets bounds on variance of unbiased estimators of the parameter via derivatives of $q$ entropy against the parameter. The inequality holds for a wide range of distributions and allows us to derive lower bounds for variance of any unbiased estimator. Results obtained here have wide applicability across different disciplines for designing and analyzing statistical inference methods."
"This paper investigates the problem of coordinated beamforming in dense wireless cooperative networks, which is a crucial issue in achieving high data rates and energy efficiency in modern wireless communication systems. To address this problem, we propose a scalable coordinated beamforming algorithm that can efficiently coordinate the transmission of multiple base stations and user devices, while also mitigating the interference caused by dense network deployments. The proposed algorithm leverages the sparsity of the channel matrix and the statistical characteristics of the wireless channel to jointly optimize the beamforming vectors and power allocation across multiple cooperating nodes. The algorithm can be implemented in a distributed manner, making it suitable for large-scale networks with a large number of base stations and user devices. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm through simulations in various network scenarios, including different network densities, user densities, and antenna configurations. The simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves significant performance gains compared to state-of-the-art beamforming techniques, especially in dense network scenarios. Overall, our proposed algorithm provides a scalable and efficient solution to the coordinated beamforming problem in dense wireless cooperative networks, which has important implications for the design of future wireless communication systems.","This paper studies coordinated beamforming in dense wireless cooperative networks as an important issue for high data rates and energy efficiency in modern wireless communications.

"In recent years, the demand for wireless communication services has increased dramatically, leading to a scarcity of radio spectrum. One potential solution to this problem is spectrum sharing, which allows multiple operators to access the same frequency band and utilize it more efficiently. However, there are various technical and economic challenges associated with spectrum sharing, such as interference and coordination costs. To overcome these challenges and incentivize spectrum sharing, some countries have implemented subsidy regulations, which provide financial support to operators who participate in spectrum sharing. This paper aims to investigate the impact of subsidy regulations on the incentives of spectrum sharing. By conducting a literature review, the paper identifies the various forms of subsidy regulations and their objectives. The paper also analyzes the effects of different subsidy mechanisms on the incentives of spectrum sharing, such as the level of subsidies, the allocation criteria, and the duration of subsidies. The findings of this research suggest that subsidy regulations can effectively incentivize spectrum sharing by reducing the coordination costs and increasing the benefits of shared use. However, the design of subsidy mechanisms is crucial for achieving the desired outcomes, as the level and allocation of subsidies can impact the incentives of different operators. The paper concludes by discussing the potential trade-offs between the benefits and drawbacks of subsidy regulations, and provides recommendations for policymakers to optimize the use of subsidies in spectrum sharing. In summary, this paper highlights the importance of subsidy regulations in promoting spectrum sharing and provides insights into the design of effective subsidy mechanisms. The findings of this study can inform policymakers and regulators in their efforts to allocate and manage the radio spectrum more efficiently.","Recently, there has been a sharp increase in demand for wireless communications services and consequently a shortage of radio spectrum. One approach to addressing this shortage is to share spectrum among different service providers; this can allow them to use the same band more efficiently. However, there are many technical and economic obstacles to sharing spectrum including interferences and coordination expenses. To mitigate these challenges and to stimulate sharing, some countries have put in place subsidy policies that provide financial support to those who engage in spectrum sharing. This paper investigates how these subsidy policies influence incentives for sharing. Through a literature review, we identify different types of subsidy policies and their goals. We analyze how different subsidy mechanisms affect incentives for sharing such as the level of subsidies, allocation criteria, and subsidy duration. Results indicate that subsidies can effectively stimulate sharing by lowering coordination costs and raising benefits from shared use. However, the design of subsidy mechanisms is key for achieving results; levels and allocations of subsidies can affect different operators differently. We conclude by considering tradeoffs between pros and cons of subsidy policies and offer recommendations to policymakers to improve subsidy usage for sharing. Overall, our work points out the importance of subsidy policies to promote sharing and suggests ways to design effective subsidy schemes. Results of this study could guide policymakers and regulators in more efficient management and allocation of radio spectrum."
