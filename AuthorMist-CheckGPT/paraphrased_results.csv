"This paper proposes a novel method for accelerating the process of neural architecture search (NAS) using performance prediction. NAS is a time-consuming process that involves searching for an optimal neural network architecture for a given task by evaluating a large number of candidate architectures.

"Combinatorial auctions are widely used to allocate goods and services to multiple bidders, who have preferences over bundles of items rather than individual items. In theory, truthful mechanisms are considered the most desirable, as they incentivize bidders to reveal their true preferences, which in turn leads to efficient allocation of resources. However, truthful mechanisms can be restrictive and may not be able to handle certain auction settings or market conditions. This paper proposes an approach to interpolate between truthful and non-truthful mechanisms for combinatorial auctions, which allows for a more flexible and adaptable auction design. We present a general framework that allows for the design of mechanisms that are truthful in some regions of the preference space, while being non-truthful in others. We propose a family of mechanisms that interpolate between two extremes: a truthful mechanism that incentivizes bidders to reveal their true preferences, and a non-truthful mechanism that maximizes revenue for the auctioneer. Our proposed mechanisms are computationally efficient, and they achieve close-to-optimal social welfare and revenue in experiments. We analyze the properties of our mechanisms, including the range of preference profiles for which they are truthful, their sensitivity to strategic behavior, and their computational complexity. We show that our mechanisms are robust to deviations from truthfulness, and they achieve high social welfare and revenue even in the presence of strategic bidders. Our proposed approach can be applied to a wide range of combinatorial auction settings, including multi-unit auctions, auctions with budget constraints, and auctions with uncertainty. The flexibility of our approach makes it an attractive tool for designing auctions that balance efficiency, revenue, and incentives, while taking into account the specific characteristics of the market and the bidders' preferences.","Combinatorial auctions allocate goods and services among different bidders who value bundles of items rather than single items. In theory, mechanisms that elicit truthful preferences are best because this reduces inefficiencies. However, such mechanisms can be limiting and sometimes fail under certain circumstances. This paper introduces an approach for interpolating between truthful and untruthful mechanisms. Thus we can design more flexible auction designs. We introduce a general framework for designing mechanisms that are truthful in certain regions of preference space and also allow for non truthfulness elsewhere. We propose a family of mechanisms that go from one extreme to another: a truthful mechanism that encourages bidding truthfully and another that maximizes auction revenue regardless of bidder truthfulness. Mechanisms are designed efficiently and perform well experimentally in terms of welfare and revenue. We study the properties of the mechanisms, such as regions where they are truthful, how sensitive they are to strategic behavior and their computational complexity. We find that mechanisms remain robust despite violations of truthfulness and perform well in the face of strategic play. Our approach is applicable to diverse auction scenarios like auctions with multiple units, auctions with budget limitations and auctions with uncertainty. Flexibility of our method makes it appealing for designing auctions balancing efficiency, revenue and incentives according to unique market features and preferences of bidders."

"This paper explores privacy-preserving mechanisms for Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning in a large function space. SVM is a popular machine learning algorithm used in a variety of applications, including image classification, text classification, and bioinformatics. However, when working with sensitive data, there are concerns about privacy and the potential for unauthorized access to the data. To address these concerns, this paper proposes two privacy-preserving mechanisms for SVM learning. The first mechanism involves using homomorphic encryption to allow the data to be processed without ever being revealed to the learning algorithm. The second mechanism involves adding random noise to the data to obscure any sensitive information while still allowing the learning algorithm to accurately classify the data. The effectiveness of these mechanisms is evaluated on a large dataset of image classifications. The results show that both mechanisms can effectively protect the privacy of the data while still achieving high classification accuracy. This research has significant implications for industries such as healthcare, finance, and national security where sensitive data is prevalent. By providing effective privacy-preserving mechanisms, this research can help enable the use of SVM learning in situations where privacy concerns would otherwise make it impossible.","This study investigates privacy enhancing methods for performing Support Vector Machines (SVM) learning on large data sets. SVM is widely employed in many domains such as image and text classification and bioinformatics. But when dealing with sensitive information, there is a concern for privacy and risk of unauthorized access. We propose two privacy enhancing mechanisms for learning SVMs. One method uses homomorphic encryption to process data without revealing it to the learning algorithm. Another method adds random noise to data to hide sensitive information while still allowing accurate classification by the algorithm. Performance of these methods is tested on a large dataset of image classifications. Results indicate that both methods successfully protect data privacy while also performing at high levels of classification accuracy. The significance of this work is great for industries like healthcare, finance and national security where sensitive data is common. Providing effective mechanisms for protecting privacy this way allows SVM learning to become practical even in contexts where privacy issues might otherwise preclude its use."

"This empirical study explores the effects of content bundling in BitTorrent swarming systems. Using a dataset of BitTorrent downloads, we analyzed the behavior of users who downloaded bundled versus unbundled content. Our results show that bundling content can significantly increase the overall download speed for users, but it also leads to longer download times for some individual files. Additionally, we found that bundled content tended to attract a larger number of seeders and leechers, leading to more efficient use of available bandwidth. However, bundling may also lead to less efficient use of storage space for users, as they are forced to download all files in a bundle even if they only need a subset. Our findings provide insights into the trade-offs involved in bundling content in BitTorrent swarming systems, and offer implications for content providers, users, and system designers.","We explore this empirical study on effects of bundling content in swarming systems using BitTorrent. We used data from downloads to analyze user behavior of those who downloaded bundled versus unbundled content.

We also find bundling attracts a greater number of seeders and leeches which makes better use of available bandwidth. However, bundling also means users have to download multiple files that they do not necessarily use fully because they must download them all in order to get the bundled files. Overall our results point out tradeoffs involved with bundling content in BitTorrent swarm systems and suggest implications for content creators, users and designers of such systems."

"This paper explores the smoothed analysis of population protocols. Population protocols are a class of distributed algorithms that operate on networks of simple agents with limited memory and communication capabilities. The analysis of these protocols typically involves worst-case complexity bounds that do not account for the structure of the input network. Smoothed analysis is a framework that bridges the gap between worst-case and average-case analysis by measuring the performance of an algorithm on a distribution of inputs that are close to the worst-case inputs in terms of some metric. In this paper, we introduce a smoothed analysis framework for population protocols and apply it to a variety of protocols for tasks such as leader election and majority voting. We show that many protocols that have poor worst-case complexity bounds perform well in smoothed analysis, indicating that they are robust to small perturbations in the input network. We also explore the relationship between smoothed analysis and the structure of the input network, and show that protocols that perform well in smoothed analysis tend to be those that are well-suited to networks with low expansion and high connectivity. Our results have implications for the design and analysis of population protocols, as they suggest that worst-case complexity bounds may not be the most informative measure of algorithmic performance in this setting. Smoothed analysis provides a more nuanced and realistic framework for evaluating the performance of population protocols, and can help guide the development of new protocols that are both efficient and robust to variations in the input network.","This paper examines smoothed analysis in the context of population protocols. These are distributed algorithms where simple agents interact within networks having limited memory and communication resources. Usually, protocol analysis uses worst case complexity bounds which do not reflect the network input structure. Smoothed analysis is a method that bridges worst and average case analysis by measuring performance across distributions of inputs near worst cases according to a metric. In this work we develop a smoothed analysis framework for protocols and study leader election and majority voting among others. Results show that many protocols with poor worst case bounds perform well under smoothed analysis and are thus robust against small variations in input networks. We also look at relationships between smoothed analysis and input network structure and find that protocols performing well under smoothed analysis tend to fit networks with low expansion and high connectivity. Results are important because they suggest worst case bounds may not fully indicate performance quality here; smoothed analysis provides a more refined and realistic means for assessing performance and might direct future protocol design towards both efficiency and resilience to variation in input network."
"This paper explores the use of federated learning as a means of preserving global knowledge without sharing individual user data. In traditional federated learning, local models are trained on user data, which are then aggregated to create a global model. However, this approach may lead to privacy concerns, as user data is shared and may be vulnerable to attacks. To address this issue, the paper proposes a new method called ""not-true self knowledge distillation."" The not-true self knowledge distillation approach involves training a local model on a distorted version of the user's data, which maintains the overall characteristics of the data while masking the user's identity. The local models are then distilled into a global model without exposing individual user data, thereby preserving user privacy. The paper presents experimental results demonstrating that the not-true self knowledge distillation method can achieve similar accuracy as traditional federated learning, while preserving user privacy. Overall, this paper contributes to the ongoing efforts to address privacy concerns in federated learning and promote the preservation of global knowledge without compromising individual user privacy. The not-true self knowledge distillation approach has the potential to be applied in various domains, such as healthcare, finance, and transportation, where user privacy is a critical concern.","This paper studies how federated learning can preserve global knowledge while keeping users' private data safe. Traditional federated learning trains local models using users' data and aggregates them to produce a global model. But sharing user data risks privacy and makes them vulnerable to attacks. Therefore, this paper introduces a new method called ""not true self knowledge distillation"" that avoids these issues. In this method, local models are trained using distorted versions of data instead of raw user data. These models share core features but hide identities. Distillation of local models into global models prevents revealing individual data, thus preserving privacy. Experimental results show this method performs similarly to traditional federated learning and also protects privacy. Contributions of this work include reducing privacy concerns in federated learning and promoting preservation of global knowledge without sacrificing privacy of individuals. This method could apply broadly including healthcare, finance, and transportation where privacy matters greatly."
"This paper proposes a novel method for heterogeneous face frontalization using domain agnostic learning.

"This paper presents a parallel algorithm for weighted random sampling of large datasets. Weighted random sampling is a common operation in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data mining, where samples are drawn from a dataset in proportion to their weights.

"This paper focuses on enhancing the accuracy of semantic segmentation in UAV aerial videos by incorporating temporal information through a novel deep learning framework called ""uvid-net."" In recent years, UAVs have become increasingly popular for various applications, such as mapping, surveillance, and environmental monitoring. However, analyzing the massive amounts of data collected by UAVs can be challenging, especially when it comes to semantic segmentation, which involves labeling each pixel of an image with a corresponding class. Uvid-net is designed to address this challenge by exploiting the temporal information present in UAV videos. The proposed framework uses a 3D convolutional neural network to capture the spatiotemporal features of the video frames, which are then processed by a feature pyramid network to generate multi-scale feature maps. A decoder network is then used to produce the final segmentation map. To evaluate the effectiveness of uvid-net, the authors conducted experiments on two publicly available UAV aerial video datasets. The results demonstrate that uvid-net outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, especially for classes that are difficult to distinguish, such as vehicles and buildings. Overall, the results of this study suggest that uvid-net is a promising approach for semantic segmentation of UAV aerial videos. The incorporation of temporal information through 3D convolutional neural networks can significantly improve the accuracy of semantic segmentation, which can be crucial for various applications such as urban planning, disaster response, and precision agriculture.","This research looks at improving the accuracy of segmentation of images captured by UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) using a new deep learning framework named uvid net.

"This paper investigates the problem of video object segmentation, which involves accurately segmenting an object of interest from a video sequence.

"The tractability of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) has been an important topic of study in theoretical computer science for several decades. In this paper, we investigate the tractability of CSPs that can be defined by forbidden patterns. We first introduce the notion of a forbidden pattern, which is a small set of constraints that cannot appear together in any solution to a CSP. We then define a class of CSPs based on forbidden patterns and investigate their computational complexity. We show that certain classes of CSPs defined by forbidden patterns are tractable, while others are NP-hard. In particular, we identify a large class of CSPs that are polynomial-time solvable, even when the number of variables is unbounded. We also show that the complexity of a CSP defined by forbidden patterns is closely related to the structure of the forbidden patterns themselves. Our results have important implications for the design and analysis of algorithms for solving CSPs.

"The embedding capacity of information flows is a critical parameter in network communication that determines the maximum amount of information that can be transmitted without error. In this paper, we investigate the embedding capacity of information flows under renewal traffic, a type of traffic pattern in which inter-arrival times between consecutive packets follow a probability distribution that may change over time. Using a theoretical framework based on queueing theory, we derive analytical expressions for the embedding capacity of different types of channels under renewal traffic. We show that the embedding capacity is strongly dependent on the statistical properties of the inter-arrival time distribution, and that it may exhibit counterintuitive behavior such as decreasing with increasing arrival rate or becoming infinite for some parameter regimes. We also investigate the effect of various system parameters such as channel capacity, noise level, and packet size on the embedding capacity. Our numerical results show that the embedding capacity may be significantly enhanced by using coding schemes that exploit the temporal structure of renewal traffic. Our research contributes to the fundamental understanding of information transmission in communication networks and provides insights into the design of efficient coding schemes for practical applications.

"This paper aims to investigate the effect of heteroscedasticity on the design of linear classifiers in linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Linear discriminant analysis is a widely used statistical method for classification problems. However, it is often assumed that the variance of the predictor variables is constant across classes, which is not always the case in real-world applications. This violation of the homoscedasticity assumption can affect the performance of LDA classifiers. In this paper, we propose a modified LDA approach that accounts for heteroscedasticity by using a weighted covariance matrix in the linear discriminant function. We compare the performance of our proposed method with traditional LDA methods using simulated and real data sets under different levels of heteroscedasticity. Our simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional LDA methods when the variance of the predictor variables is not constant across classes. The proposed method also shows improved performance in the classification of real data sets with heteroscedasticity. We also provide a method to select the optimal weighting scheme to maximize the classification accuracy. Our findings suggest that accounting for heteroscedasticity is important for accurate classification in LDA, and the proposed method can be a useful tool in the design of linear classifiers in the presence of heteroscedasticity.",This paper aims to study how heteroscedasticity impacts classifier design in linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

"Autoscaling has become a crucial feature for cloud-based services to meet the varying demands of users. However, traditional autoscaling approaches rely on pre-defined scaling rules that may not adapt well to the dynamic nature of the cloud environment. This paper presents a comparative study of two novel approaches to autoscaling: self-aware and self-adaptive autoscaling. The self-aware approach leverages machine learning techniques to predict resource demands based on historical data and the current state of the system. The self-adaptive approach, on the other hand, uses control theory to dynamically adjust the scaling rules based on real-time feedback from the system. To evaluate the effectiveness of these approaches, we conducted experiments using a cloud-based application and compared the performance of the self-aware and self-adaptive approaches with traditional autoscaling. Our results show that both self-aware and self-adaptive autoscaling outperform traditional approaches in terms of reducing response time and increasing resource utilization. Additionally, the self-adaptive approach is better suited for handling sudden spikes in demand, while the self-aware approach is more effective at predicting long-term trends in resource usage. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential benefits of self-aware and self-adaptive autoscaling for cloud-based services and provides insights into their relative strengths and weaknesses. We believe that these approaches can help cloud providers to better manage their resources, improve the quality of service for users, and reduce costs associated with over-provisioning.","Auto scaling becomes important for cloud services as they need to handle fluctuating user demand. Traditional auto scaling relies on predefined rules that do not perform well because of variability in cloud environments. This paper studies two new methods for auto scaling: one called self aware and another called adaptive auto scaling. Self aware uses machine learning to forecast future resource needs based on past performance and current system status. Adaptive auto scaling uses control theory to change scaling rules according to real time system feedback. To test performance we ran an experiment with a cloud service and compared self aware and adaptive scaling against traditional scaling. Results indicate both new methods perform better than previous ones with reduced response times and higher use of resources.

We address the issues of obtaining large amounts of labeled data for supervised learning and the limitations of unsupervised methods relying on preset criteria for selecting views. This approach includes three main components: a view selection module that generates candidate views based on spatial relations; a synthesis module that creates synthetic images for selected candidates via a generative model; and an evaluation module that uses a discriminator to assess synthetic quality and select high quality views. Experiments on a public dataset of cardiac MR images show that this new approach surpasses previous unsupervised methods both in image quality and selection accuracy. Results also indicate that performance compares favorably with supervised methods requiring many labeled examples. In summary, this new approach offers a promising solution for automatic view selection in cardiac MRI through leveraging spatial relationships and using unsupervised learning. This new approach could reduce annotation burdens and enhance efficiency and accuracy of cardiac MRI."
"This paper explores the relationship between logics and games for true concurrency, with the aim of providing a comprehensive framework for reasoning about concurrent systems. The paper begins by introducing the concept of true concurrency, which is the ability of a system to have multiple processes executing simultaneously. It then reviews existing models of true concurrency, highlighting their strengths and limitations.

"This paper explores the effectiveness of Tree Memory Networks (TMNs) as a tool for modeling long-term temporal dependencies in sequential data. Traditional neural networks struggle to capture complex long-term dependencies because they are limited by their finite memory capacity. TMNs are a type of recursive neural network that can explicitly model long-term dependencies in a hierarchical fashion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TMNs in capturing long-term dependencies by comparing their performance to traditional neural networks on a variety of sequential data tasks, including natural language processing and music generation. We show that TMNs outperform traditional networks in capturing long-term dependencies and achieving state-of-the-art results in these tasks. We also analyze the interpretability of TMNs by visualizing the learned hierarchical structures, showing that TMNs capture meaningful linguistic and musical features that align with human intuition. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of TMNs in fields such as natural language understanding, speech recognition, and time series analysis. Our results suggest that TMNs are a promising approach for modeling long-term temporal dependencies, and provide insight into the neural mechanisms underlying long-term memory processing.","This paper looks at whether Tree Memory Networks (TMNs) work well for learning long dependencies over time from sequences of data.

"This paper proposes a hybrid transfer network for cross-modal common representation learning, which aims to learn a joint representation space for multiple modalities such as text, image, and audio. The proposed model utilizes both unsupervised and supervised learning approaches to address the challenge of mapping the heterogeneous modalities into a common space while preserving the relevant information of each modality.

"This paper presents Cryptoguard, a tool for high precision detection of cryptographic vulnerabilities in massive-sized Java projects. Cryptography is essential for securing sensitive data in computer systems, but it can also be a source of vulnerabilities if not implemented correctly. The large size of modern software projects makes it challenging to manually identify and remediate such vulnerabilities.

It employs a set of rules based on best practices and guidelines from cryptographic standards to flag potential vulnerabilities. The tool is designed to be highly precise, minimizing false positives and ensuring that only genuine vulnerabilities are reported. The evaluation of Cryptoguard on a dataset of 12 popular open-source Java projects demonstrates its effectiveness in identifying cryptographic vulnerabilities with high precision. The results show that Cryptoguard can detect vulnerabilities that are not detected by other similar tools, and that it is able to identify both known and previously unknown vulnerabilities. In conclusion, Cryptoguard is a powerful tool for automated detection of cryptographic vulnerabilities in large-scale Java projects. It can assist developers in identifying and remediating these vulnerabilities, thereby improving the security of software systems.","This paper introduces Cryptoguard, an instrument for very high precision detection of cryptographic flaws in huge Java projects.

"This paper presents a study of age of information (AoI) minimization for an energy harvesting source that updates erasures, both with and without feedback. AoI is a metric that measures the freshness of data being transmitted in a communication system. The study focuses on the scenario where a source has limited energy resources and must harvest energy from its environment to perform updates. The source also experiences erasures, which cause it to lose information and increase the AoI. The study compares the AoI performance of two cases: one with feedback, where the source receives information about the status of its updates, and one without feedback, where the source has no information about the status of its updates. The results of the study show that feedback can significantly improve the AoI performance of the energy harvesting source in the presence of erasures. The findings have important implications for the design of energy-efficient communication systems that must maintain fresh data.","This paper investigates minimizing Age of Information (AoI) using a device that harvests energy and updates even when erasures occur. AoI measures how recent data is being transmitted in a communication system. This study considers a situation where a source has limited energy and must gather energy from the surroundings to do updates. The source sometimes loses information due to erasures which increases AoI. Comparing different situations, one with feedback where the source receives information about status of updates and another one without feedback where there is no such information, this study shows that feedback improves performance of energy harvesting source especially with erasures. Results have implications for designing efficient communication systems that need fresh data."

"This paper explores the interrelationships between generalized $q$-entropies and a generalized Fisher information. The $q$-entropies provide a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy and have found applications in fields such as statistical mechanics, information theory, and signal processing. The generalized Fisher information, on the other hand, characterizes the amount of information contained in a probability distribution about a parameter of interest. The paper establishes a Cram√©r-Rao inequality involving the $q$-entropies and the generalized Fisher information, which bounds the variance of any unbiased estimator of the parameter of interest in terms of the derivative of the $q$-entropy with respect to the parameter. The inequality is shown to hold for a broad class of probability distributions and can be used to derive lower bounds on the variance of any unbiased estimator. These results have implications for the design and analysis of statistical inference procedures in a variety of fields.","This paper studies the connection between generalized $q$ entropies and a generalized Fisher information. Generalized $q$ entropies are an expansion upon classical Shannon entropy and have been applied in statistical mechanics, information theory, and signal processing.

In this paper we establish an inequality related to Cramer Rao and this inequality links $q$ entropy and Fisher information. We show that this inequality works for a wide range of probability distributions and allows us to derive lower bounds on variances of unbiased estimators of interest parameters. Results of this kind are useful for designing and analyzing statistical inference methods across different disciplines."

"In recent years, the demand for wireless communication services has increased dramatically, leading to a scarcity of radio spectrum. One potential solution to this problem is spectrum sharing, which allows multiple operators to access the same frequency band and utilize it more efficiently. However, there are various technical and economic challenges associated with spectrum sharing, such as interference and coordination costs. To overcome these challenges and incentivize spectrum sharing, some countries have implemented subsidy regulations, which provide financial support to operators who participate in spectrum sharing. This paper aims to investigate the impact of subsidy regulations on the incentives of spectrum sharing. By conducting a literature review, the paper identifies the various forms of subsidy regulations and their objectives. The paper also analyzes the effects of different subsidy mechanisms on the incentives of spectrum sharing, such as the level of subsidies, the allocation criteria, and the duration of subsidies. The findings of this research suggest that subsidy regulations can effectively incentivize spectrum sharing by reducing the coordination costs and increasing the benefits of shared use. However, the design of subsidy mechanisms is crucial for achieving the desired outcomes, as the level and allocation of subsidies can impact the incentives of different operators. The paper concludes by discussing the potential trade-offs between the benefits and drawbacks of subsidy regulations, and provides recommendations for policymakers to optimize the use of subsidies in spectrum sharing. In summary, this paper highlights the importance of subsidy regulations in promoting spectrum sharing and provides insights into the design of effective subsidy mechanisms. The findings of this study can inform policymakers and regulators in their efforts to allocate and manage the radio spectrum more efficiently.","Recently demand for wireless communication services has grown significantly leading to shortage of radio spectrum. One possible approach to solve this issue is sharing spectrum among different service providers. But this approach faces many technical and financial hurdles such as interference and coordination costs. Some countries have put in place subsidy regulations which provide financial aid to those who share spectrum. This paper seeks to examine how such subsidies influence motivation to share spectrum. Through a review of literature, we identify various types of subsidy regulations and their goals. We also analyze different mechanisms of subsidies and their impacts including subsidy levels, allocation criteria and subsidy duration. Findings show that subsidies effectively motivate sharing by lowering coordination costs and boosting benefits of sharing. However, careful design of subsidy mechanisms is essential because level and allocation of subsidies affect different providers differently. Concluding remarks discuss pros and cons of using subsidies and offer policy recommendations to maximize benefits from spectrum sharing. Overall, this paper stresses importance of subsidies for promoting sharing and suggests guidance for designing effective subsidy schemes. Results from this study can guide policymakers and regulators towards more efficient spectrum allocation and management."
