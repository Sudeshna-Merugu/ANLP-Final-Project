"This paper proposes a novel method for representative selection in big data using a combination of sparse graph and geodesic Grassmann manifold distance. The goal of representative selection is to identify a small subset of data points that capture the essential characteristics of the larger dataset, making it possible to analyze and draw conclusions from the data more efficiently.

Next, it selects a representative from each cluster by computing the geodesic Grassmann manifold distance between each pair of data points and selecting the point that is closest to the mean of the cluster in the Grassmann manifold. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments on several real-world datasets.

"With the increasing demand for high-speed connectivity and mobile network coverage, drone-mounted base stations have emerged as a promising solution to enhance network coverage in remote and disaster-stricken areas. However, handover management, which refers to the process of transferring a user's connection from one base station to another, remains a critical issue for drone-mounted base stations due to their high mobility and limited coverage. In this paper, we propose a group handover strategy for drone-mounted base stations in mobile networks. The proposed group handover strategy aims to minimize the handover latency and ensure seamless connectivity for multiple users when the drone-mounted base station is in motion.

"The theory of matchings in set families has been an active area of research since the seminal work of Erdős and Kleitman in 1971.

"This paper presents a lower bound for the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem on deterministic Turing machines. The SAT problem is a fundamental problem in computer science, which asks whether a given boolean formula can be satisfied by some assignment of truth values to its variables. The lower bound established in this paper states that any deterministic Turing machine algorithm that solves the SAT problem requires at least 2^n / poly(n) time, where n is the number of variables in the input formula and poly(n) is some polynomial function of n. To prove this lower bound, the paper introduces a novel technique for constructing hard instances of the SAT problem that require a large number of steps to solve on a Turing machine. The technique is based on the notion of ""expanding"" formulas, which involves adding redundant clauses to the formula in such a way that any satisfying assignment must satisfy a large subset of the added clauses. The paper then shows that any deterministic Turing machine algorithm for the SAT problem must spend a significant amount of time checking these redundant clauses, which leads to the lower bound. The significance of this result is that it provides a strong lower bound for the SAT problem on deterministic Turing machines, which is a widely studied problem in theoretical computer science. The lower bound implies that there is a fundamental limit to the efficiency of any deterministic algorithm for solving the SAT problem, which has important implications for the design and analysis of algorithms in general. The paper concludes by discussing some potential avenues for future research based on the techniques developed in this work.","This study establishes a minimum time requirement for solving the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem using deterministic Turing machines. The SAT challenge revolves around determining if a given Boolean expression can be true under specific conditions. Our research demonstrates that any algorithm designed to solve SAT problems on deterministic Turing machines must take at least 2^n / poly(n) time, where n represents the number of variables in the input formula and poly(n) is a polynomial function of n. To demonstrate this, we introduced a new method to create particularly difficult SAT problems that necessitate substantial computational effort to resolve on a Turing machine. This method involves augmenting the original formula with extra clauses, ensuring that solving these modified problems requires verifying many of the newly added clauses. We prove that any algorithm tackling SAT problems on deterministic Turing machines must spend considerable time validating these supplementary clauses, which ultimately results in our minimum time requirement. This finding is crucial because it indicates a fundamental barrier to the efficiency of any deterministic approach to solving SAT problems, impacting how we design and analyze algorithms across various fields. The study concludes with suggestions for further research inspired by the methodologies we've outlined."
"In this paper, we present a parallel implementation of the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) based on a modified Cholesky decomposition. The EnKF is a popular data assimilation method that uses a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the state of a complex dynamic system. However, its implementation can be computationally expensive, especially for large-scale problems. To address this issue, we propose a parallel implementation of the EnKF that leverages the modified Cholesky decomposition to distribute the computation across multiple processors. The modified Cholesky decomposition is a matrix factorization method that provides an efficient way to compute the square root of a positive-definite matrix. By using this technique, our parallel implementation of the EnKF is able to significantly reduce the computation time without sacrificing accuracy. The performance of the parallel implementation is evaluated using numerical experiments, and the results show that it is able to achieve substantial speed-ups compared to a sequential implementation of the EnKF. This work has implications for a wide range of applications, including weather forecasting, climate modeling, and seismic imaging, where the EnKF is used to process large amounts of data in real-time.","This paper introduces a parallel version of the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), utilizing a revised Cholesky decomposition technique. The EnKF is a widely recognized method for estimating states in complex systems through Monte Carlo simulations. However, its execution can be quite resource-intensive, particularly for extensive datasets. To tackle this challenge, we've developed a parallelized version of the EnKF that takes advantage of the Cholesky decomposition method, which splits computations across multiple processors. The modified Cholesky decomposition breaks down matrices into simpler components, making the computation of square roots more efficient. By employing this strategy, our parallelized EnKF successfully reduces processing times without compromising precision. The effectiveness of our parallel approach was tested through computational experiments, demonstrating notable improvements over a sequential implementation of the EnKF. Our research holds significant potential for various fields such as weather prediction, climate modeling, and seismic analysis, where real-time processing of voluminous data relies on the EnKF."
"The increasing popularity of YouTube as a platform for content sharing has raised concerns about the potential risks to children from exposure to harmful or inappropriate content. This paper focuses on the detection, characterization, and analysis of child unsafe content and promoters on YouTube. We conducted a large-scale analysis of the Kidstube dataset, consisting of over 100,000 videos, to identify content that poses a risk to children, including violent, sexual, and misleading content. We also analyzed the behavior of promoters who exploit children's vulnerabilities for their benefit, including through the use of deceptive advertising and manipulation of search algorithms. Our results provide insights into the prevalence of child unsafe content on YouTube, the tactics used by promoters to attract young audiences, and the potential impact on children's wellbeing. The findings highlight the need for improved detection and removal of harmful content, as well as better regulation of advertising practices on the platform to protect children from harm.","With YouTube becoming more popular for sharing content, there are growing concerns about the potential dangers it could pose to children, especially when they come across inappropriate or harmful material. This study examines how to detect, characterize, and analyze such potentially risky content on YouTube. We examined a vast dataset of nearly 100,000 videos from the Kidstube collection to identify videos that could be harmful to children, focusing on violent, sexual, and misleading content. Additionally, we looked at how promoters manipulate children’s emotions or beliefs to gain profit, often using deceptive advertisements and manipulating search results. Our research provides valuable information on the frequency of child-unfriendly content on YouTube, the ways promoters attract young viewers, and the possible consequences on children’s mental health. The research underscores the necessity for enhanced detection and removal of harmful content, as well as stricter control over advertising methods on the platform to safeguard children from potential harm."
