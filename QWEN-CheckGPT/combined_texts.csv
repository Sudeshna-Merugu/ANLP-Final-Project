"Since Erd≈ës and Kleitman's pioneering work in 1971, the study of matchings within set families has remained a vibrant field of research. In this paper, we explore two key challenges in this domain: the maximum matching problem and the maximal matching problem. The maximum matching problem aims to identify the largest possible subset of edges that don't share any vertices. We've developed a novel algorithm that delivers a higher edge count in the matching than previous methods, rendering it more efficient for larger datasets. Meanwhile, the maximal matching problem focuses on finding the largest set of edges where no additional edges can be added without violating the matching rules. By examining the underlying combinatorial structures, we've introduced a novel metric known as the maximal matching degree. This metric allows us to establish a new upper limit on the maximal matching degree, contributing to our understanding of when maximal matchings are likely to exist. These findings build upon earlier research and offer fresh insights into the complexities of matchings within set families, with potential applications across computer science, operations research, and beyond.",1,AI
"The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, in particular, the Machine Learning area, counts on a wide range of performance metrics and benchmark data sets to assess the problem-solving effectiveness of its solutions. However, the appearance of research centres, projects or institutions addressing AI solutions from a multidisciplinary and multi-stakeholder perspective suggests a new approach to assessment comprising ethical guidelines, reports or tools and frameworks to help both academia and business to move towards a responsible conceptualisation of AI. They all highlight the relevance of three key aspects: (i) enhancing cooperation among the different stakeholders involved in the design, deployment and use of AI; (ii) promoting multidisciplinary dialogue, including different domains of expertise in this process; and (iii) fostering public engagement to maximise a trusted relation with new technologies and practitioners. In this paper, we introduce the Observatory on Society and Artificial Intelligence (OSAI), an initiative grew out of the project AI4EU aimed at stimulating reflection on a broad spectrum of issues of AI (ethical, legal, social, economic and cultural). In particular, we describe our work in progress around OSAI and suggest how this and similar initiatives can promote a wider appraisal of progress in AI. This will give us the opportunity to present our vision and our modus operandi to enhance the implementation of these three fundamental dimensions.",0,Human
"In this paper, we present the design, implementation and our year-long maintenance experience of SNSAPI, a Python-based middleware which unifies the interfaces and data structures of heterogeneous Social Networking Services (SNS). Unlike most prior works, our middleware is user-oriented and requires zero infrastructure support. It enables a user to readily conduct online social activities in a programmable, cross-platform fashion while gradually reducing the dependence on centralized Online Social Networks (OSN). More importantly, as the SNSAPI middleware can be used to support decentralized social networking services via conventional communication channels such as RSS or Email, it enables the deployment of Decentralized Social Networks (DSN) in an incremental, ad hoc manner. To demonstrate the viability of such type of DSNs, we have deployed an experimental 6000-node SNSAPI-based DSN on PlanetLab and evaluate its performance by replaying traces of online social activities collected from a mainstream OSN. Our results show that, with only mild resource consumption, the SNSAPI-based DSN can achieve acceptable forwarding latency comparable to that of a centralized OSN. We also develop an analytical model to characterize the trade-offs between resource consumption and message forwarding delay in our DSN. Via 20 parameterized experiments on PlanetLab, we have found that the empirical measurement results match reasonably with the performance predicted by our analytical model.",0,Human
"Fueled by the rapid development of communication networks and sensors in portable devices, today many mobile users are invited by content providers to sense and send back real-time useful information (e.g., traffic observations and sensor data) to keep the freshness of the providers' content updates. However, due to the sampling cost in sensing and transmission, an individual may not have the incentive to contribute the real-time information to help a content provider reduce the age of information (AoI). Accordingly, we propose dynamic pricing for the provider to offer age-dependent monetary returns and encourage users to sample information at different rates over time. This dynamic pricing design problem needs to balance the monetary payments to users and the AoI evolution over time, and is challenging to solve especially under the incomplete information about users' arrivals and their private sampling costs. For analysis tractability, we linearize the nonlinear AoI evolution in the constrained dynamic programming problem, by approximating the dynamic AoI reduction as a time-average term and solving the approximate dynamic pricing in closed-form. Then, we estimate this approximate term based on Brouwer's fixed-point theorem. Finally, we provide the steady-state analysis of the optimized approximate dynamic pricing scheme for an infinite time horizon, and show that the pricing scheme can be further simplified to an e-optimal version without recursive computing over time.",0,Human

"Successful design of human-in-the-loop control systems requires appropriate models for human decision makers. Whilst most paradigms adopted in the control systems literature hide the (limited) decision capability of humans, in behavioral economics individual decision making and optimization processes are well-known to be affected by perceptual and behavioral biases. Our goal is to enrich control engineering with some insights from behavioral economics research through exposing such biases in control-relevant settings. This paper addresses the following two key questions: 1) How do behavioral biases affect decision making? 2) What is the role played by feedback in human-in-the-loop control systems? Our experimental framework shows how individuals behave when faced with the task of piloting an UAV under risk and uncertainty, paralleling a real-world decision-making scenario. Our findings support the notion of humans in Cyberphysical Systems underlying behavioral biases regardless of -- or even because of -- receiving immediate outcome feedback. We observe substantial shares of drone controllers to act inefficiently through either flying excessively (overconfident) or overly conservatively (underconfident). Furthermore, we observe human-controllers to self-servingly misinterpret random sequences through being subject to a ""hot hand fallacy"". We advise control engineers to mind the human component in order not to compromise technological accomplishments through human issues.",0,Human
"This paper studies radio propagation mechanisms that impact handoffs, air interface design, beam steering, and MIMO for 5G mobile communication systems. Knife edge diffraction (KED) and a creeping wave linear model are shown to predict diffraction loss around typical building objects from 10 to 26 GHz, and human blockage measurements at 73 GHz are shown to fit a double knife-edge diffraction (DKED) model which incorporates antenna gains. Small-scale spatial fading of millimeter wave received signal voltage amplitude is generally Ricean-distributed for both omnidirectional and directional receive antenna patterns under both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions in most cases, although the log-normal distribution fits measured data better for the omnidirectional receive antenna pattern in the NLOS environment. Small-scale spatial autocorrelations of received voltage amplitudes are shown to fit sinusoidal exponential and exponential functions for LOS and NLOS environments, respectively, with small decorrelation distances of 0.27 cm to 13.6 cm (smaller than the size of a handset) that are favorable for spatial multiplexing. Local area measurements using cluster and route scenarios show how the received signal changes as the mobile moves and transitions from LOS to NLOS locations, with reasonably stationary signal levels within clusters. Wideband mmWave power levels are shown to fade from 0.4 dB/ms to 40 dB/s, depending on travel speed and surroundings.",0,Human
"Let $G=(V,E)$ be an $n$-nodes non-negatively real-weighted undirected graph. In this paper we show how to enrich a {\em single-source shortest-path tree} (SPT) of $G$ with a \emph{sparse} set of \emph{auxiliary} edges selected from $E$, in order to create a structure which tolerates effectively a \emph{path failure} in the SPT. This consists of a simultaneous fault of a set $F$ of at most $f$ adjacent edges along a shortest path emanating from the source, and it is recognized as one of the most frequent disruption in an SPT. We show that, for any integer parameter $k \geq 1$, it is possible to provide a very sparse (i.e., of size $O(kn\cdot f^{1+1/k})$) auxiliary structure that carefully approximates (i.e., within a stretch factor of $(2k-1)(2|F|+1)$) the true shortest paths from the source during the lifetime of the failure. Moreover, we show that our construction can be further refined to get a stretch factor of $3$ and a size of $O(n \log n)$ for the special case $f=2$, and that it can be converted into a very efficient \emph{approximate-distance sensitivity oracle}, that allows to quickly (even in optimal time, if $k=1$) reconstruct the shortest paths (w.r.t. our structure) from the source after a path failure, thus permitting to perform promptly the needed rerouting operations. Our structure compares favorably with previous known solutions, as we discuss in the paper, and moreover it is also very effective in practice, as we assess through a large set of experiments.",0,Human
"The nuclear norm minimization (NNM) is commonly used to approximate the matrix rank by shrinking all singular values equally. However, the singular values have clear physical meanings in many practical problems, and NNM may not be able to faithfully approximate the matrix rank. To alleviate the above-mentioned limitation of NNM, recent studies have suggested that the weighted nuclear norm minimization (WNNM) can achieve a better rank estimation than NNM, which heuristically set the weight being inverse to the singular values. However, it still lacks a rigorous explanation why WNNM is more effective than NMM in various applications. In this paper, we analyze NNM and WNNM from the perspective of group sparse representation (GSR). Concretely, an adaptive dictionary learning method is devised to connect the rank minimization and GSR models. Based on the proposed dictionary, we prove that NNM and WNNM are equivalent to L1-norm minimization and the weighted L1-norm minimization in GSR, respectively. Inspired by enhancing sparsity of the weighted L1-norm minimization in comparison with L1-norm minimization in sparse representation, we thus explain that WNNM is more effective than NMM. By integrating the image nonlocal self-similarity (NSS) prior with the WNNM model, we then apply it to solve the image denoising problem. Experimental results demonstrate that WNNM is more effective than NNM and outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in both objective and perceptual quality.",0,Human

"This paper introduces a new method for bidirectional updates on detailed medical records using blockchain technology. Current practices for managing medical data tend to be slow, prone to mistakes, and don't provide much transparency. The suggested system seeks to resolve these issues by utilizing blockchain's security and non-modifiable nature to facilitate quick and clear bidirectional updates on medical information.

"Multi-view detection incorporates multiple camera views to alleviate occlusion in crowded scenes, where the state-of-the-art approaches adopt homography transformations to project multi-view features to the ground plane. However, we find that these 2D transformations do not take into account the object's height, and with this neglection features along the vertical direction of same object are likely not projected onto the same ground plane point, leading to impure ground-plane features. To solve this problem, we propose VFA, voxelized 3D feature aggregation, for feature transformation and aggregation in multi-view detection. Specifically, we voxelize the 3D space, project the voxels onto each camera view, and associate 2D features with these projected voxels. This allows us to identify and then aggregate 2D features along the same vertical line, alleviating projection distortions to a large extent. Additionally, because different kinds of objects (human vs. cattle) have different shapes on the ground plane, we introduce the oriented Gaussian encoding to match such shapes, leading to increased accuracy and efficiency. We perform experiments on multiview 2D detection and multiview 3D detection problems. Results on four datasets (including a newly introduced MultiviewC dataset) show that our system is very competitive compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. %Our code and data will be open-sourced.Code and MultiviewC are released at https://github.com/Robert-Mar/VFA.",0,Human

"Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is an asymptomatic retinal disease which may result in loss of vision. There is limited access to high-quality relevant retinal images and poor understanding of the features defining sub-classes of this disease. Motivated by recent advances in machine learning we specifically explore the potential of generative modeling, using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and style transferring, to facilitate clinical diagnosis and disease understanding by feature extraction. We design an analytic pipeline which first generates synthetic retinal images from clinical images; a subsequent verification step is applied. In the synthesizing step we merge GANs (DCGANs and WGANs architectures) and style transferring for the image generation, whereas the verified step controls the accuracy of the generated images. We find that the generated images contain sufficient pathological details to facilitate ophthalmologists' task of disease classification and in discovery of disease relevant features. In particular, our system predicts the drusen and geographic atrophy sub-classes of AMD. Furthermore, the performance using CFP images for GANs outperforms the classification based on using only the original clinical dataset.

"This paper suggests an innovative method for label-guided graph exploration, allowing users to customize the proportion of labels utilized during the process. Label-guided navigation is widely employed to traverse through large and intricate graphs, where labels act as navigational aids directing exploration towards significant nodes. However, conventional techniques usually apply a predetermined ratio of labels, which might not always be ideal depending on specific situations. Our proposal permits users to modify this ratio according to their unique requirements and objectives. We develop a novel algorithm that adjusts the label ratio dynamically based on the current stage of exploration. This algorithm considers several aspects like graph density, label distribution, and user feedback to identify the most efficient label ratio.

"Despite the tremendous success of BitTorrent, its swarming system suffers from a fundamental limitation: lower or no availability of unpopular contents. Recently, Menasche et al. has shown that bundling is a promising solution to mitigate this availability problem; it improves the availability and reduces download times for unpopular contents by combining multiple files into a single swarm. There also have been studies on bundling strategies and performance issues in bundled swarms. In spite of the recent surge of interest in the benefits of and strategies for bundling, there are still little empirical grounding for understanding, describing, and modeling it. This is the first empirical study that measures and analyzes how prevalent contents bundling is in BitTorrent and how peers access the bundled contents, in comparison to the other non-bundled (i.e., single-filed) ones. To our surprise, we found that around 70% of BitTorrent swarms contain multiple files, which indicate that bundling has become widespread for contents sharing. We also show that the amount of bytes shared in bundled swarms is estimated to be around 85% out of all the BitTorrent contents logged in our datasets. Inspired from our findings, we raise and discuss three important research questions in the field of file sharing systems as well as future contents-oriented networking: i) bundling strategies, ii) bundling-aware sharing systems in BitTorrent, and iii) implications on content-oriented networking.",0,Human

"Millions of drivers worldwide have enjoyed financial benefits and work schedule flexibility through a ride-sharing economy, but meanwhile they have suffered from the lack of a sense of identity and career achievement. Equipped with social identity and contest theories, financially incentivized team competitions have been an effective instrument to increase drivers' productivity, job satisfaction, and retention, and to improve revenue over cost for ride-sharing platforms.

"Current performance-driven building design methods are not widely adopted outside the research field for several reasons that make them difficult to integrate into a typical design process. In the early design phase, in particular, the time-intensity and the cognitive load associated with optimization and form parametrization are incompatible with design exploration, which requires quick iteration. This research introduces a novel method for performance-driven geometry generation that can afford interaction directly in the 3d modeling environment, eliminating the need for explicit parametrization, and is multiple orders faster than the equivalent form optimization. The method uses Machine Learning techniques to train a generative model offline. The generative model learns a distribution of optimal performing geometries and their simulation contexts based on a dataset that addresses the performance(s) of interest. By navigating the generative model's latent space, geometries with the desired characteristics can be quickly generated. A case study is presented, demonstrating the generation of a synthetic dataset and the use of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as a generative model for geometries with optimal solar gain.

"Volume transmission is an important neural communication pathway in which neurons in one brain region influence the neurotransmitter concentration in the extracellular space of a distant brain region. In this paper, we apply asymptotic analysis to a stochastic partial differential equation model of volume transmission to calculate the neurotransmitter concentration in the extracellular space. Our model involves the diffusion equation in a three-dimensional domain with interior holes that randomly switch between being either sources or sinks. These holes model nerve varicosities that alternate between releasing and absorbing neurotransmitter, according to when they fire action potentials. In the case that the holes are small, we compute analytically the first two nonzero terms in an asymptotic expansion of the average neurotransmitter concentration. The first term shows that the concentration is spatially constant to leading order and that this constant is independent of many details in the problem. Specifically, this constant first term is independent of the number and location of nerve varicosities, neural firing correlations, and the size and geometry of the extracellular space. The second term shows how these factors affect the concentration at second order. Interestingly, the second term is also spatially constant under some mild assumptions. We verify our asymptotic results by high-order numerical simulation using radial basis function-generated finite differences.",0,Human

"A new method is introduced to bolster the security of Industry 4.0 systems by utilizing Quorum-Based Cloud-Edge Distributed Deep Neural Networks (QUDOS). With the rise of cloud-based applications and services in Industry 4.0, there's been an increase in the need for secure and efficient data processing. However, traditional security measures fall short in tackling the current complex threat landscape. To tackle this issue, the researchers propose QUDOS, which is a quorum-based system for securely executing deep neural networks in a hybrid cloud-edge computing setup. QUDOS harnesses the benefits of both cloud and edge computing to offer a robust and effective solution for data processing in Industry 4.0.

Furthermore, QUDOS implements secure multi-party computation methods to safeguard sensitive data from being compromised during the DNN execution phase. The researchers have tested and validated the performance and security of QUDOS through various experiments and simulations, highlighting its capability to deliver high accuracy and minimal latency. Moreover, their findings indicate that QUDOS surpasses current top-tier security solutions in terms of both accuracy and latency, making it a compelling option for secure and efficient data processing in Industry 4.0 systems.

"Single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection aims at separating small targets from clutter backgrounds. With the advances of deep learning, CNN-based methods have yielded promising results in generic object detection due to their powerful modeling capability. However, existing CNN-based methods cannot be directly applied for infrared small targets since pooling layers in their networks could lead to the loss of targets in deep layers. To handle this problem, we propose a dense nested attention network (DNANet) in this paper. Specifically, we design a dense nested interactive module (DNIM) to achieve progressive interaction among high-level and low-level features. With the repeated interaction in DNIM, infrared small targets in deep layers can be maintained. Based on DNIM, we further propose a cascaded channel and spatial attention module (CSAM) to adaptively enhance multi-level features. With our DNANet, contextual information of small targets can be well incorporated and fully exploited by repeated fusion and enhancement. Moreover, we develop an infrared small target dataset (namely, NUDT-SIRST) and propose a set of evaluation metrics to conduct comprehensive performance evaluation. Experiments on both public and our self-developed datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves better performance in terms of probability of detection (Pd), false-alarm rate (Fa), and intersection of union (IoU).",0,Human
"Chatter identification and detection in machining processes has been an active area of research in the past two decades. Part of the challenge in studying chatter is that machining equations that describe its occurrence are often nonlinear delay differential equations. The majority of the available tools for chatter identification rely on defining a metric that captures the characteristics of chatter, and a threshold that signals its occurrence. The difficulty in choosing these parameters can be somewhat alleviated by utilizing machine learning techniques. However, even with a successful classification algorithm, the transferability of typical machine learning methods from one data set to another remains very limited. In this paper we combine supervised machine learning with Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to obtain a descriptor of the process which can detect chatter. The features we use are derived from the persistence diagram of an attractor reconstructed from the time series via Takens embedding. We test the approach using deterministic and stochastic turning models, where the stochasticity is introduced via the cutting coefficient term. Our results show a 97% successful classification rate on the deterministic model labeled by the stability diagram obtained using the spectral element method. The features gleaned from the deterministic model are then utilized for characterization of chatter in a stochastic turning model where there are very limited analysis methods.",0,Human

"Unstructured data from diverse sources, such as social media and aerial imagery, can provide valuable up-to-date information for intelligent situation assessment. Mining these different information sources could bring major benefits to applications such as situation awareness in disaster zones and mapping the spread of diseases. Such applications depend on classifying the situation across a region of interest, which can be depicted as a spatial ""heatmap"". Annotating unstructured data using crowdsourcing or automated classifiers produces individual classifications at sparse locations that typically contain many errors. We propose a novel Bayesian approach that models the relevance, error rates and bias of each information source, enabling us to learn a spatial Gaussian Process classifier by aggregating data from multiple sources with varying reliability and relevance. Our method does not require gold-labelled data and can make predictions at any location in an area of interest given only sparse observations. We show empirically that our approach can handle noisy and biased data sources, and that simultaneously inferring reliability and transferring information between neighbouring reports leads to more accurate predictions. We demonstrate our method on two real-world problems from disaster response, showing how our approach reduces the amount of crowdsourced data required and can be used to generate valuable heatmap visualisations from SMS messages and satellite images.",0,Human

"Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been integrated in several models of recommendation to augment the informational value of an item by means of its related entities in the graph. Yet, existing datasets only provide explicit ratings on items and no information is provided about user opinions of other (non-recommendable) entities. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new dataset, called the MindReader, providing explicit user ratings both for items and for KG entities. In this first version, the MindReader dataset provides more than 102 thousands explicit ratings collected from 1,174 real users on both items and entities from a KG in the movie domain. This dataset has been collected through an online interview application that we also release open source. As a demonstration of the importance of this new dataset, we present a comparative study of the effect of the inclusion of ratings on non-item KG entities in a variety of state-of-the-art recommendation models. In particular, we show that most models, whether designed specifically for graph data or not, see improvements in recommendation quality when trained on explicit non-item ratings. Moreover, for some models, we show that non-item ratings can effectively replace item ratings without loss of recommendation quality. This finding, thanks also to an observed greater familiarity of users towards common KG entities than towards long-tail items, motivates the use of KG entities for both warm and cold-start recommendations.",0,Human

"Existing color-guided depth super-resolution (DSR) approaches require paired RGB-D data as training samples where the RGB image is used as structural guidance to recover the degraded depth map due to their geometrical similarity. However, the paired data may be limited or expensive to be collected in actual testing environment. Therefore, we explore for the first time to learn the cross-modality knowledge at training stage, where both RGB and depth modalities are available, but test on the target dataset, where only single depth modality exists. Our key idea is to distill the knowledge of scene structural guidance from RGB modality to the single DSR task without changing its network architecture. Specifically, we construct an auxiliary depth estimation (DE) task that takes an RGB image as input to estimate a depth map, and train both DSR task and DE task collaboratively to boost the performance of DSR. Upon this, a cross-task interaction module is proposed to realize bilateral cross task knowledge transfer. First, we design a cross-task distillation scheme that encourages DSR and DE networks to learn from each other in a teacher-student role-exchanging fashion. Then, we advance a structure prediction (SP) task that provides extra structure regularization to help both DSR and DE networks learn more informative structure representations for depth recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our scheme achieves superior performance in comparison with other DSR methods.",0,Human

"Recently, the problem of inaccurate learning targets in crowd counting draws increasing attention. Inspired by a few pioneering work, we solve this problem by trying to predict the indices of pre-defined interval bins of counts instead of the count values themselves. However, an inappropriate interval setting might make the count error contributions from different intervals extremely imbalanced, leading to inferior counting performance. Therefore, we propose a novel count interval partition criterion called Uniform Error Partition (UEP), which always keeps the expected counting error contributions equal for all intervals to minimize the prediction risk. Then to mitigate the inevitably introduced discretization errors in the count quantization process, we propose another criterion called Mean Count Proxies (MCP). The MCP criterion selects the best count proxy for each interval to represent its count value during inference, making the overall expected discretization error of an image nearly negligible. As far as we are aware, this work is the first to delve into such a classification task and ends up with a promising solution for count interval partition. Following the above two theoretically demonstrated criterions, we propose a simple yet effective model termed Uniform Error Partition Network (UEPNet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several challenging datasets. The codes will be available at: https://github.com/TencentYoutuResearch/CrowdCounting-UEPNet.",0,Human
"Low-precision representation of deep neural networks (DNNs) is critical for efficient deployment of deep learning application on embedded platforms, however, converting the network to low precision degrades its performance. Crucially, networks that are designed for embedded applications usually suffer from increased degradation since they have less redundancy. This is most evident for the ubiquitous MobileNet architecture which requires a costly quantization-aware training cycle to achieve acceptable performance when quantized to 8-bits. In this paper, we trace the source of the degradation in MobileNets to a shift in the mean activation value. This shift is caused by an inherent bias in the quantization process which builds up across layers, shifting all network statistics away from the learned distribution. We show that this phenomenon happens in other architectures as well. We propose a simple remedy - compensating for the quantization induced shift by adding a constant to the additive bias term of each channel. We develop two simple methods for estimating the correction constants - one using iterative evaluation of the quantized network and one where the constants are set using a short training phase. Both methods are fast and require only a small amount of unlabeled data, making them appealing for rapid deployment of neural networks. Using the above methods we are able to match the performance of training-based quantization of MobileNets at a fraction of the cost.",0,Human

"Reinforcement Learning is proving a successful tool that can manage urban intersections with a fraction of the effort required to curate traditional traffic controllers. However, literature on the introduction and control of pedestrians to such intersections is scarce. Furthermore, it is unclear what traffic state variables should be used as reward to obtain the best agent performance. This paper robustly evaluates 30 different Reinforcement Learning reward functions for controlling intersections serving pedestrians and vehicles covering the main traffic state variables available via modern vision-based sensors. Some rewards proposed in previous literature solely for vehicular traffic are extended to pedestrians while new ones are introduced. We use a calibrated model in terms of demand, sensors, green times and other operational constraints of a real intersection in Greater Manchester, UK. The assessed rewards can be classified in 5 groups depending on the magnitudes used: queues, waiting time, delay, average speed and throughput in the junction. The performance of different agents, in terms of waiting time, is compared across different demand levels, from normal operation to saturation of traditional adaptive controllers. We find that those rewards maximising the speed of the network obtain the lowest waiting time for vehicles and pedestrians simultaneously, closely followed by queue minimisation, demonstrating better performance than other previously proposed methods.",0,Human
"The ability to segment teeth precisely from digitized 3D dental models is an essential task in computer-aided orthodontic surgical planning. To date, deep learning based methods have been popularly used to handle this task. State-of-the-art methods directly concatenate the raw attributes of 3D inputs, namely coordinates and normal vectors of mesh cells, to train a single-stream network for fully-automated tooth segmentation. This, however, has the drawback of ignoring the different geometric meanings provided by those raw attributes. This issue might possibly confuse the network in learning discriminative geometric features and result in many isolated false predictions on the dental model. Against this issue, we propose a two-stream graph convolutional network (TSGCNet) to learn multi-view geometric information from different geometric attributes. Our TSGCNet adopts two graph-learning streams, designed in an input-aware fashion, to extract more discriminative high-level geometric representations from coordinates and normal vectors, respectively. These feature representations learned from the designed two different streams are further fused to integrate the multi-view complementary information for the cell-wise dense prediction task. We evaluate our proposed TSGCNet on a real-patient dataset of dental models acquired by 3D intraoral scanners, and experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for 3D shape segmentation.",0,Human

"CNNs have excelled at performing place recognition over time, particularly when the neural network is optimized for localization in the current environmental conditions. In this paper we investigate the concept of feature map filtering, where, rather than using all the activations within a convolutional tensor, only the most useful activations are used. Since specific feature maps encode different visual features, the objective is to remove feature maps that are detract from the ability to recognize a location across appearance changes. Our key innovation is to filter the feature maps in an early convolutional layer, but then continue to run the network and extract a feature vector using a later layer in the same network. By filtering early visual features and extracting a feature vector from a higher, more viewpoint invariant later layer, we demonstrate improved condition and viewpoint invariance. Our approach requires image pairs for training from the deployment environment, but we show that state-of-the-art performance can regularly be achieved with as little as a single training image pair. An exhaustive experimental analysis is performed to determine the full scope of causality between early layer filtering and late layer extraction.

"This research evaluates two popular techniques used to solve vehicle routing problems (VRPs): sequence optimization and set optimization. Sequence optimization focuses on rearranging the visit order for each vehicle, whereas set optimization divides the set of customers into distinct groups served by separate vehicles.

"We consider Bayesian optimization of the output of a network of functions, where each function takes as input the output of its parent nodes, and where the network takes significant time to evaluate. Such problems arise, for example, in reinforcement learning, engineering design, and manufacturing. While the standard Bayesian optimization approach observes only the final output, our approach delivers greater query efficiency by leveraging information that the former ignores: intermediate output within the network. This is achieved by modeling the nodes of the network using Gaussian processes and choosing the points to evaluate using, as our acquisition function, the expected improvement computed with respect to the implied posterior on the objective. Although the non-Gaussian nature of this posterior prevents computing our acquisition function in closed form, we show that it can be efficiently maximized via sample average approximation. In addition, we prove that our method is asymptotically consistent, meaning that it finds a globally optimal solution as the number of evaluations grows to infinity, thus generalizing previously known convergence results for the expected improvement. Notably, this holds even though our method might not evaluate the domain densely, instead leveraging problem structure to leave regions unexplored. Finally, we show that our approach dramatically outperforms standard Bayesian optimization methods in several synthetic and real-world problems.",0,Human

"This research introduces precise limits for randomized load balancing across various network configurations. Load balancing is crucial in distributed computing, and random methods have become popular for tackling this challenge. Yet, past studies offered less precise estimates for how well these random algorithms perform under diverse network setups.

"Compile-time information flow analysis has been a promising technique for protecting confidentiality and integrity of private data. In the last couple of decades, a large number of information flow security tools in the form of run-time execution-monitors or static type systems have been developed for programming languages to analyze information flow security policies. However, existing flow analysis tools lack in precision and usability, which is the primary reason behind not being widely adopted in real application development. In this paper, we propose a compile-time information flow analysis for an imperative program based on a hybrid (mutable + immutable) labelling approach that enables a user to detect information flow-policy breaches and modify the program to overcome violations. We have developed an information flow security analyzer for a dialect of Python language, PyX, called Pifthon using the said approach. The flow-analyzer aids in identifying possible misuse of the information in sequential PyX programs corresponding to a given information flow policy (IFP). Pifthon has distinct advantages like reduced labelling overhead that ameliorates usability, covers a wide range of PyX programs that include termination-and progress-sensitive channels, in contrast to other approaches in the literature. The proposed flow analysis is proved to be sound under the classical non-interference property. Further, case study and experience in the usage of Pifthon are provided.",0,Human

"We study exploration in stochastic multi-armed bandits when we have access to a divisible resource that can be allocated in varying amounts to arm pulls. We focus in particular on the allocation of distributed computing resources, where we may obtain results faster by allocating more resources per pull, but might have reduced throughput due to nonlinear scaling. For example, in simulation-based scientific studies, an expensive simulation can be sped up by running it on multiple cores. This speed-up however, is partly offset by the communication among cores, which results in lower throughput than if fewer cores were allocated per trial to run more trials in parallel. In this paper, we explore these trade-offs in two settings. First, in a fixed confidence setting, we need to find the best arm with a given target success probability as quickly as possible. We propose an algorithm which trades off between information accumulation and throughput and show that the time taken can be upper bounded by the solution of a dynamic program whose inputs are the gaps between the sub-optimal and optimal arms. We also prove a matching hardness result. Second, we present an algorithm for a fixed deadline setting, where we are given a time deadline and need to maximize the probability of finding the best arm. We corroborate our theoretical insights with simulation experiments that show that the algorithms consistently match or outperform baseline algorithms on a variety of problem instances.",0,Human
"Vulnerable software represents a tremendous threat to modern information systems. Vulnerabilities in widespread applications may be used to spread malware, steal money and conduct target attacks. To address this problem, developers and researchers use different approaches of dynamic and static software analysis; one of these approaches is called fuzzing. Fuzzing is performed by generating and sending potentially malformed data to an application under test. Since first appearance in 1988, fuzzing has evolved a lot, but issues which addressed to effectiveness evaluation have not fully investigated until now. In our research, we propose a novel approach of fuzzing effectiveness evaluation, taking into account semantics of executed code along with a quantitative assessment. For this purpose, we use specific metrics of source code complexity assessment adapted to perform analysis of machine code. We conducted effectiveness evaluation of these metrics on 104 widespread applications with known vulnerabilities. As a result of these experiments, we were able to identify a set of metrics that are more suitable to find bugs. In addition, we conducted separate experiments on 7 applications without known vulnerabilities by using the set of metrics. The experimental results confirmed that proposed approach can be applied to increase performance of the fuzzing. Moreover, the tools helped detect two critical zero day (previously unknown) vulnerabilities in the wide-spread applications.",0,Human
"Distributed storage systems employ codes to provide resilience to failure of multiple storage disks. Specifically, an $(n, k)$ MDS code stores $k$ symbols in $n$ disks such that the overall system is tolerant to a failure of up to $n-k$ disks. However, access to at least $k$ disks is still required to repair a single erasure. To reduce repair bandwidth, array codes are used where the stored symbols or packets are vectors of length $\ell$. MDS array codes have the potential to repair a single erasure using a fraction $1/(n-k)$ of data stored in the remaining disks. We introduce new methods of analysis which capitalize on the translation of the storage system problem into a geometric problem on a set of operators and subspaces. In particular, we ask the following question: for a given $(n, k)$, what is the minimum vector-length or sub-packetization factor $\ell$ required to achieve this optimal fraction? For \emph{exact recovery} of systematic disks in an MDS code of low redundancy, i.e. $k/n > 1/2$, the best known explicit codes \cite{WTB12} have a sub-packetization factor $\ell$ which is exponential in $k$. It has been conjectured \cite{TWB12} that for a fixed number of parity nodes, it is in fact necessary for $\ell$ to be exponential in $k$. In this paper, we provide a new log-squared converse bound on $k$ for a given $\ell$, and prove that $k \le 2\log_2\ell\left(\log_{\delta}\ell+1\right)$, for an arbitrary number of parity nodes $r = n-k$, where $\delta = r/(r-1)$.",0,Human

"The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to billions of devices connecting to the internet. However, this expansion introduces significant security issues due to the limited resources and weak security features of many IoT gadgets. To tackle these problems, the OSCAR (Object Security Architecture for the IoT) was developed. This lightweight architecture utilizes object-oriented security strategies to safeguard IoT devices against diverse types of attacks. The OSCAR design includes three key elements: object modeling, object security, and object communication. Object modeling describes the structure and functions of IoT objects along with their security features. Object security aims to shield these objects and their characteristics from potential security threats. Lastly, object communication sets out the protocols and procedures for secure interactions between IoT objects. Performance evaluations based on various factors such as memory and processing costs, communication delays, and energy usage indicate that OSCAR offers solid security protection while requiring little extra resource consumption. It supports essential security measures like confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and access management. Compared to other IoT security frameworks, OSCAR emerges as a superior choice in terms of both security strength and efficiency. Moreover, OSCAR has been successfully tested on multiple IoT devices, including sensors, actuators, and gateways, showcasing its practical application and effectiveness. In summary, the OSCAR architecture represents an efficient and adaptable approach to securing IoT devices, applicable across different IoT systems and networks. By leveraging object-oriented security techniques, OSCAR ensures robust security without imposing substantial overhead demands.",1,AI

"Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have created a general perception that AI could be used to solve complex problems, and in some situations over-hyped as a tool that can be so easily used. Unfortunately, the barrier to realization of mass adoption of AI on various business domains is too high because most domain experts have no background in AI. Developing AI applications involves multiple phases, namely data preparation, application modeling, and product deployment. The effort of AI research has been spent mostly on new AI models (in the model training stage) to improve the performance of benchmark tasks such as image recognition. Many other factors such as usability, efficiency and security of AI have not been well addressed, and therefore form a barrier to democratizing AI. Further, for many real world applications such as healthcare and autonomous driving, learning via huge amounts of possibility exploration is not feasible since humans are involved. In many complex applications such as healthcare, subject matter experts (e.g. Clinicians) are the ones who appreciate the importance of features that affect health, and their knowledge together with existing knowledge bases are critical to the end results. In this paper, we take a new perspective on developing AI solutions, and present a solution for making AI usable. We hope that this resolution will enable all subject matter experts (eg. Clinicians) to exploit AI like data scientists.",0,Human

"Several cybersecurity domains, such as ransomware detection, forensics and data analysis, require methods to reliably identify encrypted data fragments. Typically, current approaches employ statistics derived from byte-level distribution, such as entropy estimation, to identify encrypted fragments. However, modern content types use compression techniques which alter data distribution pushing it closer to the uniform distribution. The result is that current approaches exhibit unreliable encryption detection performance when compressed data appears in the dataset. Furthermore, proposed approaches are typically evaluated over few data types and fragment sizes, making it hard to assess their practical applicability. This paper compares existing statistical tests on a large, standardized dataset and shows that current approaches consistently fail to distinguish encrypted and compressed data on both small and large fragment sizes. We address these shortcomings and design EnCoD, a learning-based classifier which can reliably distinguish compressed and encrypted data. We evaluate EnCoD on a dataset of 16 different file types and fragment sizes ranging from 512B to 8KB. Our results highlight that EnCoD outperforms current approaches by a wide margin, with accuracy ranging from ~82 for 512B fragments up to ~92 for 8KB data fragments. Moreover, EnCoD can pinpoint the exact format of a given data fragment, rather than performing only binary classification like previous approaches.",0,Human
"In system identification, estimating parameters of a model using limited observations results in poor identifiability. To cope with this issue, we propose a new method to simultaneously select and estimate sensitive parameters as key model parameters and fix the remaining parameters to a set of typical values. Our method is formulated as a nonlinear least squares estimator with L1-regularization on the deviation of parameters from a set of typical values. First, we provide consistency and oracle properties of the proposed estimator as a theoretical foundation. Second, we provide a novel approach based on Levenberg-Marquardt optimization to numerically find the solution to the formulated problem. Third, to show the effectiveness, we present an application identifying a biomechanical parametric model of a head position tracking task for 10 human subjects from limited data. In a simulation study, the variances of estimated parameters are decreased by 96.1% as compared to that of the estimated parameters without L1-regularization. In an experimental study, our method improves the model interpretation by reducing the number of parameters to be estimated while maintaining variance accounted for (VAF) at above 82.5%. Moreover, the variances of estimated parameters are reduced by 71.1% as compared to that of the estimated parameters without L1-regularization. Our method is 54 times faster than the standard simplex-based optimization to solve the regularized nonlinear regression.",0,Human
"Conventional RGB-D salient object detection methods aim to leverage depth as complementary information to find the salient regions in both modalities. However, the salient object detection results heavily rely on the quality of captured depth data which sometimes are unavailable. In this work, we make the first attempt to solve the RGB-D salient object detection problem with a novel depth-awareness framework. This framework only relies on RGB data in the testing phase, utilizing captured depth data as supervision for representation learning. To construct our framework as well as achieving accurate salient detection results, we propose a Ubiquitous Target Awareness (UTA) network to solve three important challenges in RGB-D SOD task: 1) a depth awareness module to excavate depth information and to mine ambiguous regions via adaptive depth-error weights, 2) a spatial-aware cross-modal interaction and a channel-aware cross-level interaction, exploiting the low-level boundary cues and amplifying high-level salient channels, and 3) a gated multi-scale predictor module to perceive the object saliency in different contextual scales. Besides its high performance, our proposed UTA network is depth-free for inference and runs in real-time with 43 FPS. Experimental evidence demonstrates that our proposed network not only surpasses the state-of-the-art methods on five public RGB-D SOD benchmarks by a large margin, but also verifies its extensibility on five public RGB SOD benchmarks.",0,Human
"Properly designed precoders can significantly improve the spectral efficiency of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay systems. In this paper, we investigate joint source and relay precoding design based on the mean-square-error (MSE) criterion in MIMO two-way relay systems, where two multi-antenna source nodes exchange information via a multi-antenna amplify-and-forward relay node. This problem is non-convex and its optimal solution remains unsolved. Aiming to find an efficient way to solve the problem, we first decouple the primal problem into three tractable sub-problems, and then propose an iterative precoding design algorithm based on alternating optimization. The solution to each sub-problem is optimal and unique, thus the convergence of the iterative algorithm is guaranteed. Secondly, we propose a structured precoding design to lower the computational complexity. The proposed precoding structure is able to parallelize the channels in the multiple access (MAC) phase and broadcast (BC) phase. It thus reduces the precoding design to a simple power allocation problem. Lastly, for the special case where only a single data stream is transmitted from each source node, we present a source-antenna-selection (SAS) based precoding design algorithm. This algorithm selects only one antenna for transmission from each source and thus requires lower signalling overhead. Comprehensive simulation is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of all the proposed precoding designs.",0,Human
"In the last decade, scenario-based serious-games have become a main tool for learning new skills and capabilities. An important factor in the development of such systems is the overhead in time, cost and human resources to manually create the content for these scenarios. We focus on how to create content for scenarios in medical, military, commerce and gaming applications where maintaining the integrity and coherence of the content is integral for the system's success. To do so, we present an automatic method for generating content about everyday activities through combining computer science techniques with the crowd. We use the crowd in three basic ways: to capture a database of scenarios of everyday activities, to generate a database of likely replacements for specific events within that scenario, and to evaluate the resulting scenarios. We found that the generated scenarios were rated as reliable and consistent by the crowd when compared to the scenarios that were originally captured. We also compared the generated scenarios to those created by traditional planning techniques. We found that both methods were equally effective in generated reliable and consistent scenarios, yet the main advantages of our approach is that the content we generate is more varied and much easier to create. We have begun integrating this approach within a scenario-based training application for novice investigators within the law enforcement departments to improve their questioning skills.",0,Human

"This study introduces a new method for creating an energy-efficient artificial neuron utilizing superconducting nanowires. The neuron design includes a superconducting loop with a nanowire junction capable of adjusting its response to input signals. This junction acts as the neuron's activation function, and its minimal power usage is due to the use of superconductivity to remove resistance from the loop. We've created a comprehensive model of our proposed neuron and conducted thorough simulations to illustrate its performance features.

"This paper presents a discrete-time option pricing model that is rooted in Reinforcement Learning (RL), and more specifically in the famous Q-Learning method of RL. We construct a risk-adjusted Markov Decision Process for a discrete-time version of the classical Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model, where the option price is an optimal Q-function, while the optimal hedge is a second argument of this optimal Q-function, so that both the price and hedge are parts of the same formula. Pricing is done by learning to dynamically optimize risk-adjusted returns for an option replicating portfolio, as in the Markowitz portfolio theory. Using Q-Learning and related methods, once created in a parametric setting, the model is able to go model-free and learn to price and hedge an option directly from data, and without an explicit model of the world. This suggests that RL may provide efficient data-driven and model-free methods for optimal pricing and hedging of options, once we depart from the academic continuous-time limit, and vice versa, option pricing methods developed in Mathematical Finance may be viewed as special cases of model-based Reinforcement Learning. Further, due to simplicity and tractability of our model which only needs basic linear algebra (plus Monte Carlo simulation, if we work with synthetic data), and its close relation to the original BSM model, we suggest that our model could be used for benchmarking of different RL algorithms for financial trading applications",0,Human
"We consider a decentralized networked control system (DNCS) consisting of a remote controller and a collection of linear plants, each associated with a local controller. Each local controller directly observes the state of its co-located plant and can inform the remote controller of the plant's state through an unreliable uplink channel. The downlink channels from the remote controller to local controllers were assumed to be perfect. The objective of the local controllers and the remote controller is to cooperatively minimize the infinite horizon time average of expected quadratic cost. The finite horizon version of this problem was solved in our prior work [2]. The optimal strategies in the finite horizon case were shown to be characterized by coupled Riccati recursions. In this paper, we show that if the link failure probabilities are below certain critical thresholds, then the coupled Riccati recursions of the finite horizon solution reach a steady state and the corresponding decentralized strategies are optimal. Above these thresholds, we show that no strategy can achieve finite cost. We exploit a connection between our DNCS Riccati recursions and the coupled Riccati recursions of an auxiliary Markov jump linear system to obtain our results. Our main results in Theorems 1 and 2 explicitly identify the critical thresholds for the link failure probabilities and the optimal decentralized control strategies when all link failure probabilities are below their thresholds.",0,Human
"We explore the value of weak labels in learning transferable representations for medical images. Compared to hand-labeled datasets, weak or inexact labels can be acquired in large quantities at significantly lower cost and can provide useful training signals for data-hungry models such as deep neural networks. We consider weak labels in the form of pseudo-labels and propose a semi-weakly supervised contrastive learning (SWCL) framework for representation learning using semi-weakly annotated images. Specifically, we train a semi-supervised model to propagate labels from a small dataset consisting of diverse image-level annotations to a large unlabeled dataset. Using the propagated labels, we generate a patch-level dataset for pretraining and formulate a multi-label contrastive learning objective to capture position-specific features encoded in each patch. We empirically validate the transfer learning performance of SWCL on seven public retinal fundus datasets, covering three disease classification tasks and two anatomical structure segmentation tasks. Our experiment results suggest that, under very low data regime, large-scale ImageNet pretraining on improved architecture remains a very strong baseline, and recently proposed self-supervised methods falter in segmentation tasks, possibly due to the strong invariant constraint imposed. Our method surpasses all prior self-supervised methods and standard cross-entropy training, while closing the gaps with ImageNet pretraining.",0,Human
"The analysis of the structure of musical pieces is a task that remains a challenge for Artificial Intelligence, especially in the field of Deep Learning. It requires prior identification of structural boundaries of the music pieces. This structural boundary analysis has recently been studied with unsupervised methods and \textit{end-to-end} techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using Mel-Scaled Log-magnitude Spectograms features (MLS), Self-Similarity Matrices (SSM) or Self-Similarity Lag Matrices (SSLM) as inputs and trained with human annotations. Several studies have been published divided into unsupervised and \textit{end-to-end} methods in which pre-processing is done in different ways, using different distance metrics and audio characteristics, so a generalized pre-processing method to compute model inputs is missing. The objective of this work is to establish a general method of pre-processing these inputs by comparing the inputs calculated from different pooling strategies, distance metrics and audio characteristics, also taking into account the computing time to obtain them. We also establish the most effective combination of inputs to be delivered to the CNN in order to establish the most efficient way to extract the limits of the structure of the music pieces. With an adequate combination of input matrices and pooling strategies we obtain a measurement accuracy $F_1$ of 0.411 that outperforms the current one obtained under the same conditions.",0,Human
"A common writing style for statistical results are the recommendations of the American Psychology Association, known as APA-style. However, in practice, writing styles vary as reports are not 100% following APA-style or parameters are not reported despite being mandatory. In addition, the statistics are not reported in isolation but in context of experimental conditions investigated and the general topic. We address these challenges by proposing a flexible pipeline STEREO based on active wrapper induction and unsupervised aspect extraction. We applied our pipeline to the over 100,000 documents in the CORD-19 dataset. It required only 0.25% of the corpus (about 500 documents) to learn statistics extraction rules that cover 95% of the sentences in CORD-19. The statistic extraction has nearly 100% precision on APA-conform and 95% precision on non-APA writing styles. In total, we were able to extract 113k reported statistics, of which only <1% is APA conform. We could extract in 46% the correct conditions from APA-conform reports (30% for non-APA). The best model for topic extraction achieves a precision of 75% on statistics reported in APA style (73% for non-APA conform). We conclude that STEREO is a good foundation for automatic statistic extraction and future developments for scientific paper analysis. Particularly the extraction of non-APA conform reports is important and allows applications such as giving feedback to authors about what is missing and could be changed.",0,Human
"This paper introduces a parallel version of the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), utilizing a revised Cholesky decomposition technique. The EnKF is a widely recognized method for estimating states in complex systems through Monte Carlo simulations. However, its execution can be quite resource-intensive, particularly for extensive datasets. To tackle this challenge, we've developed a parallelized version of the EnKF that takes advantage of the Cholesky decomposition method, which splits computations across multiple processors. The modified Cholesky decomposition breaks down matrices into simpler components, making the computation of square roots more efficient. By employing this strategy, our parallelized EnKF successfully reduces processing times without compromising precision. The effectiveness of our parallel approach was tested through computational experiments, demonstrating notable improvements over a sequential implementation of the EnKF. Our research holds significant potential for various fields such as weather prediction, climate modeling, and seismic analysis, where real-time processing of voluminous data relies on the EnKF.",1,AI

In summary, our contribution enriches the field of fair allocation systems and offers a valuable solution for tackling intricate real-world resource distribution challenges.",1,AI
"Visual exploration of high-dimensional real-valued datasets is a fundamental task in exploratory data analysis (EDA). Existing methods use predefined criteria to choose the representation of data. There is a lack of methods that (i) elicit from the user what she has learned from the data and (ii) show patterns that she does not know yet. We construct a theoretical model where identified patterns can be input as knowledge to the system. The knowledge syntax here is intuitive, such as ""this set of points forms a cluster"", and requires no knowledge of maths. This background knowledge is used to find a Maximum Entropy distribution of the data, after which the system provides the user data projections in which the data and the Maximum Entropy distribution differ the most, hence showing the user aspects of the data that are maximally informative given the user's current knowledge. We provide an open source EDA system with tailored interactive visualizations to demonstrate these concepts. We study the performance of the system and present use cases on both synthetic and real data. We find that the model and the prototype system allow the user to learn information efficiently from various data sources and the system works sufficiently fast in practice. We conclude that the information theoretic approach to exploratory data analysis where patterns observed by a user are formalized as constraints provides a principled, intuitive, and efficient basis for constructing an EDA system.",0,Human
"The spectral gap $\gamma$ of a finite, ergodic, and reversible Markov chain is an important parameter measuring the asymptotic rate of convergence. In applications, the transition matrix $P$ may be unknown, yet one sample of the chain up to a fixed time $n$ may be observed. We consider here the problem of estimating $\gamma$ from this data. Let $\pi$ be the stationary distribution of $P$, and $\pi_\star = \min_x \pi(x)$. We show that if $n = \tilde{O}\bigl(\frac{1}{\gamma \pi_\star}\bigr)$, then $\gamma$ can be estimated to within multiplicative constants with high probability. When $\pi$ is uniform on $d$ states, this matches (up to logarithmic correction) a lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}\bigl(\frac{d}{\gamma}\bigr)$ steps required for precise estimation of $\gamma$. Moreover, we provide the first procedure for computing a fully data-dependent interval, from a single finite-length trajectory of the chain, that traps the mixing time $t_{\text{mix}}$ of the chain at a prescribed confidence level. The interval does not require the knowledge of any parameters of the chain. This stands in contrast to previous approaches, which either only provide point estimates, or require a reset mechanism, or additional prior knowledge. The interval is constructed around the relaxation time $t_{\text{relax}} = 1/\gamma$, which is strongly related to the mixing time, and the width of the interval converges to zero roughly at a $1/\sqrt{n}$ rate, where $n$ is the length of the sample path.",0,Human
"Recommender System research suffers currently from a disconnect between the size of academic data sets and the scale of industrial production systems. In order to bridge that gap we propose to generate more massive user/item interaction data sets by expanding pre-existing public data sets. User/item incidence matrices record interactions between users and items on a given platform as a large sparse matrix whose rows correspond to users and whose columns correspond to items. Our technique expands such matrices to larger numbers of rows (users), columns (items) and non zero values (interactions) while preserving key higher order statistical properties. We adapt the Kronecker Graph Theory to user/item incidence matrices and show that the corresponding fractal expansions preserve the fat-tailed distributions of user engagements, item popularity and singular value spectra of user/item interaction matrices. Preserving such properties is key to building large realistic synthetic data sets which in turn can be employed reliably to benchmark Recommender Systems and the systems employed to train them. We provide algorithms to produce such expansions and apply them to the MovieLens 20 million data set comprising 20 million ratings of 27K movies by 138K users. The resulting expanded data set has 10 billion ratings, 864K items and 2 million users in its smaller version and can be scaled up or down. A larger version features 655 billion ratings, 7 million items and 17 million users.",0,Human

This paper introduces a framework for representing conversations that aims to simplify the overhearing process. Our framework uses the graph structure of communication networks to condense conversational data into a manageable format that can be easily analyzed. It employs a combination of graph clustering and sequence modeling techniques to identify topics and represent conversations as sequences of topic vectors. By doing so, we can reduce the complexity of the data and enhance the efficiency of the overhearing algorithms. To test our framework, we conducted experiments using a large dataset of online forum conversations. The results showed that our framework performed better than existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrated the framework's scalability by examining various sizes of datasets, including ones with millions of messages. Overall, our framework offers a fresh approach to handling conversational data for effective overhearing. By harnessing the structure of communication networks and minimizing the complexity of the data, our framework facilitates a more efficient analysis of large-scale communication networks.",1,AI

"Since the 1990s, there have been significant advances in the technology space and the e-Commerce area, leading to an exponential increase in demand for cashless payment solutions. This has led to increased demand for credit cards, bringing along with it the possibility of higher credit defaults and hence higher delinquency rates, over a period of time. The purpose of this research paper is to build a contemporary credit scoring model to forecast credit defaults for unsecured lending (credit cards), by employing machine learning techniques. As much of the customer payments data available to lenders, for forecasting Credit defaults, is imbalanced (skewed), on account of a limited subset of default instances, this poses a challenge for predictive modelling. In this research, this challenge is addressed by deploying Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), a proven technique to iron out such imbalances, from a given dataset. On running the research dataset through seven different machine learning models, the results indicate that the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) Classifier model outperforms the other six classification techniques. Thus, our research indicates that the LGBM classifier model is better equipped to deliver higher learning speeds, better efficiencies and manage larger data volumes. We expect that deployment of this model will enable better and timely prediction of credit defaults for decision-makers in commercial lending institutions and banks.",0,Human

"There has been a remarkable increase in the data exchange over web and the widespread use of digital media. As a result, multimedia data transfers also had a boost up. The mounting interest with reference to digital watermarking throughout the last decade is certainly due to the increase in the need of copyright protection of digital content. This is also enhanced due to commercial prospective. Applications of video watermarking in copy control, broadcast monitoring, fingerprinting, video authentication, copyright protection etc is immensely rising. The main aspects of information hiding are capacity, security and robustness. Capacity deals with the amount of information that can be hidden. The skill of anyone detecting the information is security and robustness refers to the resistance to modification of the cover content before concealed information is destroyed. Video watermarking algorithms normally prefers robustness. In a robust algorithm it is not possible to eliminate the watermark without rigorous degradation of the cover content. In this paper, we introduce the notion of Video Watermarking and the features required to design a robust watermarked video for a valuable application. We review several algorithms, and introduce frequently used key techniques. The aim of this paper is to focus on the various domains of video watermarking techniques. The majority of the reviewed methods based on video watermarking emphasize on the notion of robustness of the algorithm.",0,Human

"We have designed, fabricated, and successfully tested a prototype mixed-signal, 28x28-binary-input, 10-output, 3-layer neuromorphic network (""MLP perceptron""). It is based on embedded nonvolatile floating-gate cell arrays redesigned from a commercial 180-nm NOR flash memory. The arrays allow precise (~1%) individual tuning of all memory cells, having long-term analog-level retention and low noise. Each array performs a very fast and energy-efficient analog vector-by-matrix multiplication, which is the bottleneck for signal propagation in most neuromorphic networks. All functional components of the prototype circuit, including 2 synaptic arrays with 101,780 floating-gate synaptic cells, 74 analog neurons, and the peripheral circuitry for weight adjustment and I/O operations, have a total area below 1 mm^2. Its testing on the common MNIST benchmark set (at this stage, with a relatively low weight import precision) has shown a classification fidelity of 94.65%, close to the 96.2% obtained in simulation. The classification of one pattern takes less than 1 us time and ~20 nJ energy - both numbers much better than for digital implementations of the same task. Estimates show that this performance may be further improved using a better neuron design and a more advanced memory technology, leading to a >10^2 advantage in speed and a >10^4 advantage in energy efficiency over the state-of-the-art purely digital (GPU and custom) circuits, at classification of large, complex patterns.",0,Human
"This study introduces a fresh technique for identifying deception attacks within networked control systems through a sequential detection mechanism coupled with watermarking. The suggested strategy entails inserting a distinctive watermark into the control system's input signal, followed by surveillance of the output signal for anomalies that diverge from the anticipated performance. Utilizing a sequential hypothesis testing algorithm, the presence of a deception attack is detected via the correlation between the watermark and the output signal. Simulation outcomes showcase the efficacy of this proposed approach in accurately detecting different forms of deception attacks with minimal false positives. This research offers a promising avenue to bolster the security and dependability of networked control systems against malicious intrusions.",1,AI
"This research looks into using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations with Outlier Detection (LIMEOUT) to enhance the fairness of machine learning (ML) models. LIMEOUT is a recent development that merges LIME, which clarifies ML model predictions at the local scale, with outlier detection, which pinpoints items that lie outside the typical training dataset distribution. The study illustrates LIMEOUT's effectiveness in boosting ML model fairness through its analysis on diverse benchmark datasets, each presenting unique fairness-related obstacles. The findings indicate that LIMEOUT substantially enhances ML model fairness by pinpointing and neutralizing biases in predictions. Additionally, the paper reveals that LIMEOUT can be employed to offer clear and understandable explanations for the ML model's decision-making process, thereby enhancing its credibility and accountability. In summary, the paper posits that LIMEOUT is an encouraging strategy for making ML models more just and transparent, which could aid in addressing ethical issues linked to their utilization across various sectors.",1,AI
"We consider the numerical stability of the parameter recovery problem in Linear Structural Equation Model ($\LSEM$) of causal inference. A long line of work starting from Wright (1920) has focused on understanding which sub-classes of $\LSEM$ allow for efficient parameter recovery. Despite decades of study, this question is not yet fully resolved. The goal of this paper is complementary to this line of work; we want to understand the stability of the recovery problem in the cases when efficient recovery is possible. Numerical stability of Pearl's notion of causality was first studied in Schulman and Srivastava (2016) using the concept of condition number where they provide ill-conditioned examples. In this work, we provide a condition number analysis for the $\LSEM$. First we prove that under a sufficient condition, for a certain sub-class of $\LSEM$ that are \emph{bow-free} (Brito and Pearl (2002)), the parameter recovery is stable. We further prove that \emph{randomly} chosen input parameters for this family satisfy the condition with a substantial probability. Hence for this family, on a large subset of parameter space, recovery is numerically stable. Next we construct an example of $\LSEM$ on four vertices with \emph{unbounded} condition number. We then corroborate our theoretical findings via simulations as well as real-world experiments for a sociology application. Finally, we provide a general heuristic for estimating the condition number of any $\LSEM$ instance.",0,Human
"Cybercrime markets support the development and diffusion of new attack technologies, vulnerability exploits, and malware. Whereas the revenue streams of cyber attackers have been studied multiple times in the literature, no quantitative account currently exists on the economics of attack acquisition and deployment. Yet, this understanding is critical to characterize the production of (traded) exploits, the economy that drives it, and its effects on the overall attack scenario. In this paper we provide an empirical investigation of the economics of vulnerability exploitation, and the effects of market factors on likelihood of exploit. Our data is collected first-handedly from a prominent Russian cybercrime market where the trading of the most active attack tools reported by the security industry happens. Our findings reveal that exploits in the underground are priced similarly or above vulnerabilities in legitimate bug-hunting programs, and that the refresh cycle of exploits is slower than currently often assumed. On the other hand, cybercriminals are becoming faster at introducing selected vulnerabilities, and the market is in clear expansion both in terms of players, traded exploits, and exploit pricing. We then evaluate the effects of these market variables on likelihood of attack realization, and find strong evidence of the correlation between market activity and exploit deployment. We discuss implications on vulnerability metrics, economics, and exploit measurement.",0,Human
"We consider finite horizon reach-avoid problems for discrete time stochastic systems. Our goal is to construct upper bound functions for the reach-avoid probability by means of tractable convex optimization problems. We achieve this by restricting attention to the span of Gaussian radial basis functions and imposing structural assumptions on the transition kernel of the stochastic processes as well as the target and safe sets of the reach-avoid problem. In particular, we require the kernel to be written as a Gaussian mixture density with each mean of the distribution being affine in the current state and input and the target and safe sets to be written as intersections of quadratic inequalities. Taking advantage of these structural assumptions, we formulate a recursion of semidefinite programs where each step provides an upper bound to the value function of the reach- avoid problem. The upper bounds provide a performance metric to which any suboptimal control policy can be compared, and can themselves be used to construct suboptimal control policies. We illustrate via numerical examples that even if the resulting bounds are conservative, the associated control policies achieve higher reach-avoid probabilities than heuristic controllers for problems of large state-input space dimensions (more than 20). The results presented in this paper, far exceed the limits of current approximation methods for reach-avoid problems in the specific class of stochastic systems considered.",0,Human

Experiments confirm the model's effectiveness in understanding and representing the underlying structures and meanings within sequences.",1,AI
"In Federated Learning (FL), a strong global model is collaboratively learned by aggregating the clients' locally trained models. Although this allows no need to access clients' data directly, the global model's convergence often suffers from data heterogeneity. This paper suggests that forgetting could be the bottleneck of global convergence. We observe that fitting on biased local distribution shifts the feature on global distribution and results in forgetting of global knowledge. We consider this phenomenon as an analogy to Continual Learning, which also faces catastrophic forgetting when fitted on the new task distribution. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that tackling down the forgetting in local training relives the data heterogeneity problem. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective framework Federated Local Self-Distillation (FedLSD), which utilizes the global knowledge on locally available data. By following the global perspective on local data, FedLSD encourages the learned features to preserve global knowledge and have consistent views across local models, thus improving convergence without compromising data privacy. Under our framework, we further extend FedLSD to FedLS-NTD, which only considers the not-true class signals to compensate noisy prediction of the global model. We validate that both FedLSD and FedLS-NTD significantly improve the performance in standard FL benchmarks in various setups, especially in the extreme data heterogeneity cases.",0,Human

"This study delves into the ethical considerations around actuarial risk assessments and the implementation of interventions aimed at altering forecasted results. Historically, actuarial risk assessments have relied on predictive models to pinpoint individuals deemed to be at high risk for unfavorable outcomes and allocate resources accordingly. However, critics argue that this method could lead to discriminatory practices and disparate treatment. The paper suggests shifting the discussion to emphasize interventions over predictions, advocating for an approach that addresses the underlying issues causing risk and promotes beneficial outcomes instead of just countering anticipated negative impacts. Ultimately, the authors emphasize the significance of addressing the ethical aspects of actuarial risk assessments and fostering continued discourse regarding the proper application of interventions within this domain.",1,AI

These insights support the argument that environmental pollutants can affect human health and offer important guidance for policy makers and healthcare authorities in developing safer environments.",1,AI
"We propose NormalGAN, a fast adversarial learning-based method to reconstruct the complete and detailed 3D human from a single RGB-D image. Given a single front-view RGB-D image, NormalGAN performs two steps: front-view RGB-D rectification and back-view RGBD inference. The final model was then generated by simply combining the front-view and back-view RGB-D information. However, inferring backview RGB-D image with high-quality geometric details and plausible texture is not trivial. Our key observation is: Normal maps generally encode much more information of 3D surface details than RGB and depth images. Therefore, learning geometric details from normal maps is superior than other representations. In NormalGAN, an adversarial learning framework conditioned by normal maps is introduced, which is used to not only improve the front-view depth denoising performance, but also infer the back-view depth image with surprisingly geometric details. Moreover, for texture recovery, we remove shading information from the front-view RGB image based on the refined normal map, which further improves the quality of the back-view color inference. Results and experiments on both testing data set and real captured data demonstrate the superior performance of our approach. Given a consumer RGB-D sensor, NormalGAN can generate the complete and detailed 3D human reconstruction results in 20 fps, which further enables convenient interactive experiences in telepresence, AR/VR and gaming scenarios.",0,Human

"We develop here a computationally effective approach for producing high-quality $\mathcal{H}_\infty$-approximations to large scale linear dynamical systems having multiple inputs and multiple outputs (MIMO). We extend an approach for $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ model reduction introduced by Flagg, Beattie, and Gugercin for the single-input/single-output (SISO) setting, which combined ideas originating in interpolatory $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction with complex Chebyshev approximation. Retaining this framework, our approach to the MIMO problem has its principal computational cost dominated by (sparse) linear solves, and so it can remain an effective strategy in many large-scale settings. We are able to avoid computationally demanding $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ norm calculations that are normally required to monitor progress within each optimization cycle through the use of ""data-driven"" rational approximations that are built upon previously computed function samples. Numerical examples are included that illustrate our approach. We produce high fidelity reduced models having consistently better $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ performance than models produced via balanced truncation; these models often are as good as (and occasionally better than) models produced using optimal Hankel norm approximation as well. In all cases considered, the method described here produces reduced models at far lower cost than is possible with either balanced truncation or optimal Hankel norm approximation.",0,Human
"With the explosive growth in the number of pictures taken by smartphones, organizing and searching pictures has become important tasks. To efficiently fulfill these tasks, the key enabler is annotating images with proper keywords, with which keyword-based searching and organizing become available for images. Currently, smartphones usually synchronize photo albums with cloud storage platforms, and have their images annotated with the help of cloud computing. However, the ""offloading-to-cloud"" solution may cause privacy breach, since photos from smart photos contain various sensitive information. For privacy protection, existing research made effort to support cloud-based image annotation on encrypted images by utilizing cryptographic primitives. Nevertheless, for each annotation, it requires the cloud to perform linear checking on the large-scale encrypted dataset with high computational cost. This paper proposes a cloud-assisted privacy-preserving image annotation with randomized kd-forest, namely CPAR. With CPAR, users are able to automatically assign keywords to their images by leveraging the power of cloud with privacy protected. CPAR proposes a novel privacy-preserving randomized kd-forest structure, which significantly improves the annotation performance compared with existing research. Thorough analysis is carried out to demonstrate the security of CPAR. Experimental evaluation on the well-known IAPR TC-12 dataset validates the efficiency and effectiveness of CPAR.",0,Human

"Adversarial examples are often cited by neuroscientists and machine learning researchers as an example of how computational models diverge from biological sensory systems. Recent work has proposed adding biologically-inspired components to visual neural networks as a way to improve their adversarial robustness. One surprisingly effective component for reducing adversarial vulnerability is response stochasticity, like that exhibited by biological neurons. Here, using recently developed geometrical techniques from computational neuroscience, we investigate how adversarial perturbations influence the internal representations of standard, adversarially trained, and biologically-inspired stochastic networks. We find distinct geometric signatures for each type of network, revealing different mechanisms for achieving robust representations. Next, we generalize these results to the auditory domain, showing that neural stochasticity also makes auditory models more robust to adversarial perturbations. Geometric analysis of the stochastic networks reveals overlap between representations of clean and adversarially perturbed stimuli, and quantitatively demonstrates that competing geometric effects of stochasticity mediate a tradeoff between adversarial and clean performance. Our results shed light on the strategies of robust perception utilized by adversarially trained and stochastic networks, and help explain how stochasticity may be beneficial to machine and biological computation.",0,Human

"Regression analysis-based approaches have been widely studied for face recognition (FR) in the past several years. More recently, to better deal with some difficult conditions such as occlusions and illumination, nuclear norm based matrix regression methods have been proposed to characterize the low-rank structure of the error image, which generalize the one-dimensional, pixel-based error model to the two-dimensional structure. These methods, however, are inherently devised for grayscale image based FR and without exploiting the color information which is proved beneficial for FR of color face images. Benefiting from quaternion representation, which is capable of encoding the cross-channel correlation of color images, we propose a novel color FR method by formulating the color FR problem as a nuclear norm based quaternion matrix regression (NQMR). We further develop a more robust model called R-NQMR by using the logarithm of the nuclear norm, instead of the original nuclear norm, which adaptively assigns weights on different singular values, and then extend it to deal with the mixed noise. The proposed models, then, are solved using the effective alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM). Experiments on several public face databases demonstrate the superior performance and efficacy of the proposed approaches for color FR, especially for some difficult conditions (occlusion, illumination and mixed noise) over some state-of-the-art regression analysis-based approaches.",0,Human
"This study establishes a minimum time requirement for solving the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem using deterministic Turing machines. The SAT challenge revolves around determining if a given Boolean expression can be true under specific conditions. Our research demonstrates that any algorithm designed to solve SAT problems on deterministic Turing machines must take at least 2^n / poly(n) time, where n represents the number of variables in the input formula and poly(n) is a polynomial function of n. To demonstrate this, we introduced a new method to create particularly difficult SAT problems that necessitate substantial computational effort to resolve on a Turing machine. This method involves augmenting the original formula with extra clauses, ensuring that solving these modified problems requires verifying many of the newly added clauses. We prove that any algorithm tackling SAT problems on deterministic Turing machines must spend considerable time validating these supplementary clauses, which ultimately results in our minimum time requirement. This finding is crucial because it indicates a fundamental barrier to the efficiency of any deterministic approach to solving SAT problems, impacting how we design and analyze algorithms across various fields. The study concludes with suggestions for further research inspired by the methodologies we've outlined.",1,AI

"Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has shown potential for scalable multicast of video data. However, one key drawback for NOMA-based video multicast is the limited number of layers allowed by the embedded successive interference cancellation algorithm, failing to meet satisfaction of heterogeneous receivers. We propose a novel receiver-driven superposed video multicast (Supcast) scheme by integrating Softcast, an analog-like transmission scheme, into the NOMA-based system to achieve high bandwidth efficiency as well as gradual decoding quality proportional to channel conditions at receivers. Although Softcast allows gradual performance by directly transmitting power-scaled transformation coefficients of frames, it suffers performance degradation due to discarding coefficients under insufficient bandwidth and its power allocation strategy cannot be directly applied in NOMA due to interference. In Supcast, coefficients are grouped into chunks, which are basic units for power allocation and superposition scheduling. By bisecting chunks into base-layer chunks and enhanced-layer chunks, the joint power allocation and chunk scheduling is formulated as a distortion minimization problem. A two-stage power allocation strategy and a near-optimal low-complexity algorithm for chunk scheduling based on the matching theory are proposed. Simulation results have shown the advantage of Supcast against Softcast as well as the reference scheme in NOMA under various practical scenarios.",0,Human
"Accurately modeling human decision-making in security is critical to thinking about when, why, and how to recommend that users adopt certain secure behaviors. In this work, we conduct behavioral economics experiments to model the rationality of end-user security decision-making in a realistic online experimental system simulating a bank account. We ask participants to make a financially impactful security choice, in the face of transparent risks of account compromise and benefits offered by an optional security behavior (two-factor authentication). We measure the cost and utility of adopting the security behavior via measurements of time spent executing the behavior and estimates of the participant's wage. We find that more than 50% of our participants made rational (e.g., utility optimal) decisions, and we find that participants are more likely to behave rationally in the face of higher risk. Additionally, we find that users' decisions can be modeled well as a function of past behavior (anchoring effects), knowledge of costs, and to a lesser extent, users' awareness of risks and context (R2=0.61). We also find evidence of endowment effects, as seen in other areas of economic and psychological decision-science literature, in our digital-security setting. Finally, using our data, we show theoretically that a ""one-size-fits""-all emphasis on security can lead to market losses, but that adoption by a subset of users with higher risks or lower costs can lead to market gains.",0,Human

Our paper introduces a reinforcement learning strategy to teach coordination tactics to robot swarms. Our technique employs a central critic and autonomous units that learn the coordination tactics. The central critic monitors the entire group's state and gives feedback to the autonomous units, which then act locally based on their view of the immediate surroundings. This feedback adjusts the autonomous units' policy parameters, enabling them to refine their collective actions over time. We tested our method on several benchmarks for robot swarms, such as forming shapes, avoiding obstacles, and collaborating on transport. Our findings indicate that our technique is successful in teaching coordinated action to robot swarms, delivering outstanding performance on these challenges and demonstrating adaptability to new settings too. Overall, our work highlights the potential of reinforcement learning for coaching coordination strategies in robot swarms, providing a solid groundwork for future studies in this field. The potential of this approach might allow the creation of more advanced and efficient robot swarms capable of tackling diverse tasks across various scenarios.",1,AI
"Kernel machines often yield superior predictive performance on various tasks; however, they suffer from severe computational challenges. In this paper, we show how to overcome the important challenge of speeding up kernel machines. In particular, we develop a parallel block minimization framework for solving kernel machines, including kernel SVM and kernel logistic regression. Our framework proceeds by dividing the problem into smaller subproblems by forming a block-diagonal approximation of the Hessian matrix. The subproblems are then solved approximately in parallel. After that, a communication efficient line search procedure is developed to ensure sufficient reduction of the objective function value at each iteration. We prove global linear convergence rate of the proposed method with a wide class of subproblem solvers, and our analysis covers strongly convex and some non-strongly convex functions. We apply our algorithm to solve large-scale kernel SVM problems on distributed systems, and show a significant improvement over existing parallel solvers. As an example, on the covtype dataset with half-a-million samples, our algorithm can obtain an approximate solution with 96% accuracy in 20 seconds using 32 machines, while all the other parallel kernel SVM solvers require more than 2000 seconds to achieve a solution with 95% accuracy. Moreover, our algorithm can scale to very large data sets, such as the kdd algebra dataset with 8 million samples and 20 million features.",0,Human
"This research explores how users perceive and evaluate erasure and undetected error probabilities differently in digital communication systems. It delves into why these errors are evaluated so differently by users, and identifies various contributing factors. The study starts by defining erasure and undetected errors and explains their importance in these systems. It then looks at what previous research has found about how users view these two types of errors, noting that there's not much agreement among experts. The research uses experiments to gauge how participants judge the severity and likelihood of erasure and undetected errors in a simulated digital communication setting. Participants provide both numbers and words to explain their judgments. The findings show that users typically regard undetected errors as more critical and damaging to trust than erasure errors. The study uncovers several reasons for these differing views, such as the way the system is set up, the user's past experiences, and personal attitudes towards risk. In summary, this research deepens our understanding of user error evaluations in digital communications, offering valuable advice for those designing reliable and trustworthy systems.",1,AI
"Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) help practitioners in contributing solutions to challenges of specific domains. The efficient development of user-friendly DSLs suitable for industrial practitioners with little expertise in modelling still is challenging. For such practitioners, who often do not model on a daily basis, there is a need to foster reduction of repetitive modelling tasks and providing simplified visual representations of DSL parts. For industrial language engineers, there is no methodical support for providing such guidelines or documentation as part of reusable language modules. Previous research either addresses the reuse of languages or guidelines for modelling. For the efficient industrial deployment of DSLs, their combination is essential: the efficient engineering of DSLs from reusable modules that feature integrated documentation and guidelines for industrial practitioners. To solve these challenges, we propose a systematic approach for the industrial engineering of DSLs based on the concept of reusable DSL Building Blocks, which rests on several years of experience in the industrial engineering of DSLs and their deployment to various organizations. We investigated our approach via focus group methods consisting of five participants from industry and research qualitatively. Ultimately, DSL Building Blocks support industrial language engineers in developing better usable DSLs and industrial practitioners in more efficiently achieving their modelling.",0,Human

"Dense Multi-GPU systems have recently gained a lot of attention in the HPC arena. Traditionally, MPI runtimes have been primarily designed for clusters with a large number of nodes. However, with the advent of MPI+CUDA applications and CUDA-Aware MPI runtimes like MVAPICH2 and OpenMPI, it has become important to address efficient communication schemes for such dense Multi-GPU nodes. This coupled with new application workloads brought forward by Deep Learning frameworks like Caffe and Microsoft CNTK pose additional design constraints due to very large message communication of GPU buffers during the training phase. In this context, special-purpose libraries like NVIDIA NCCL have been proposed for GPU-based collective communication on dense GPU systems.

"The world is facing a tough situation due to the catastrophic pandemic caused by novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The number people affected by this virus are increasing exponentially day by day and the number has already crossed 6.4 million. As no vaccine has been discovered yet, the early detection of patients and isolation is the only and most effective way to reduce the spread of the virus. Detecting infected persons from chest X-Ray by using Deep Neural Networks, can be applied as a time and laborsaving solution. In this study, we tried to detect Covid-19 by classification of Covid-19, pneumonia and normal chest X-Rays.

"The paper introduces an approximate dynamic programming method for managing community recovery after a natural disaster. Existing methods typically rely on rigid, predefined recovery plans that can become obsolete in rapidly changing situations.

"From the simple measurement of tissue attributes in pathology workflow to designing an explainable diagnostic/prognostic AI tool, access to accurate semantic segmentation of tissue regions in histology images is a prerequisite. However, delineating different tissue regions manually is a laborious, time-consuming and costly task that requires expert knowledge. On the other hand, the state-of-the-art automatic deep learning models for semantic segmentation require lots of annotated training data and there are only a limited number of tissue region annotated images publicly available. To obviate this issue in computational pathology projects and collect large-scale region annotations efficiently, we propose an efficient interactive segmentation network that requires minimum input from the user to accurately annotate different tissue types in the histology image. The user is only required to draw a simple squiggle inside each region of interest so it will be used as the guiding signal for the model. To deal with the complex appearance and amorph geometry of different tissue regions we introduce several automatic and minimalistic guiding signal generation techniques that help the model to become robust against the variation in the user input. By experimenting on a dataset of breast cancer images, we show that not only does our proposed method speed up the interactive annotation process, it can also outperform the existing automatic and interactive region segmentation models.",0,Human
"We propose a new approach to value function approximation which combines linear temporal difference reinforcement learning with subspace identification. In practical applications, reinforcement learning (RL) is complicated by the fact that state is either high-dimensional or partially observable. Therefore, RL methods are designed to work with features of state rather than state itself, and the success or failure of learning is often determined by the suitability of the selected features. By comparison, subspace identification (SSID) methods are designed to select a feature set which preserves as much information as possible about state. In this paper we connect the two approaches, looking at the problem of reinforcement learning with a large set of features, each of which may only be marginally useful for value function approximation. We introduce a new algorithm for this situation, called Predictive State Temporal Difference (PSTD) learning. As in SSID for predictive state representations, PSTD finds a linear compression operator that projects a large set of features down to a small set that preserves the maximum amount of predictive information. As in RL, PSTD then uses a Bellman recursion to estimate a value function. We discuss the connection between PSTD and prior approaches in RL and SSID. We prove that PSTD is statistically consistent, perform several experiments that illustrate its properties, and demonstrate its potential on a difficult optimal stopping problem.",0,Human
"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, conversational bots have became prevalent in mainstream E-commerce platforms, which can provide convenient customer service timely. To satisfy the user, the conversational bots need to understand the user's intention, detect the user's emotion, and extract the key entities from the conversational utterances. However, understanding dialogues is regarded as a very challenging task. Different from common language understanding, utterances in dialogues appear alternately from different roles and are usually organized as hierarchical structures. To facilitate the understanding of dialogues, in this paper, we propose a novel contextual dialogue encoder (i.e. DialogueBERT) based on the popular pre-trained language model BERT. Five self-supervised learning pre-training tasks are devised for learning the particularity of dialouge utterances. Four different input embeddings are integrated to catch the relationship between utterances, including turn embedding, role embedding, token embedding and position embedding. DialogueBERT was pre-trained with 70 million dialogues in real scenario, and then fine-tuned in three different downstream dialogue understanding tasks. Experimental results show that DialogueBERT achieves exciting results with 88.63% accuracy for intent recognition, 94.25% accuracy for emotion recognition and 97.04% F1 score for named entity recognition, which outperforms several strong baselines by a large margin.",0,Human
"Fishing is a beloved pastime, but many anglers encounter difficulties in locating and catching fish. This research sought to uncover the issues that anglers face and propose solutions. A survey was carried out among experienced anglers to learn more about their fishing experiences, the problems they encounter, and their favored techniques for finding and catching fish. The survey revealed that anglers frequently struggle with restricted access to fishing spots, low water quality, and dwindling fish populations. To tackle these problems, the study suggests enhancing accessibility to fishing areas, enforcing conservation measures to safeguard fish species and their ecosystems, and offering education and resources to anglers on sustainable fishing methods. These insights can guide decision-making to ensure the responsible use of fishing resources and enhance the overall fishing experience for enthusiasts.",1,AI
"We study the communication complexity of combinatorial auctions via interpolation mechanisms that interpolate between non-truthful and truthful protocols. Specifically, an interpolation mechanism has two phases. In the first phase, the bidders participate in some non-truthful protocol whose output is itself a truthful protocol. In the second phase, the bidders participate in the truthful protocol selected during phase one. Note that virtually all existing auctions have either a non-existent first phase (and are therefore truthful mechanisms), or a non-existent second phase (and are therefore just traditional protocols, analyzed via the Price of Anarchy/Stability).  The goal of this paper is to understand the benefits of interpolation mechanisms versus truthful mechanisms or traditional protocols, and develop the necessary tools to formally study them. Interestingly, we exhibit settings where interpolation mechanisms greatly outperform the optimal traditional and truthful protocols. Yet, we also exhibit settings where interpolation mechanisms are provably no better than truthful ones. Finally, we apply our new machinery to prove that the recent single-bid mechanism of Devanur et. al.~\cite{DevanurMSW15} (the only pre-existing interpolation mechanism in the literature) achieves the optimal price of anarchy among a wide class of protocols, a claim that simply can't be addressed by appealing just to machinery from communication complexity or the study of truthful mechanisms.",0,Human

"Multi-step manipulation tasks in unstructured environments are extremely challenging for a robot to learn. Such tasks interlace high-level reasoning that consists of the expected states that can be attained to achieve an overall task and low-level reasoning that decides what actions will yield these states. We propose a model-free deep reinforcement learning method to learn multi-step manipulation tasks. We introduce a Robotic Manipulation Network (RoManNet), which is a vision-based model architecture, to learn the action-value functions and predict manipulation action candidates. We define a Task Progress based Gaussian (TPG) reward function that computes the reward based on actions that lead to successful motion primitives and progress towards the overall task goal. To balance the ratio of exploration/exploitation, we introduce a Loss Adjusted Exploration (LAE) policy that determines actions from the action candidates according to the Boltzmann distribution of loss estimates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by training RoManNet to learn several challenging multi-step robotic manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of success rate and action efficiency. The ablation studies show that TPG and LAE are especially beneficial for tasks like multiple block stacking. Code is available at: https://github.com/skumra/romannet",0,Human
"A sound Decision-Making (DM) process is key to the successful governance of software projects. In many Open Source Software Development (OSSD) communities, DM processes lie buried amongst vast amounts of publicly available data. Hidden within this data lie the rationale for decisions that led to the evolution and maintenance of software products. While there have been some efforts to extract DM processes from publicly available data, the rationale behind how the decisions are made have seldom been explored. Extracting the rationale for these decisions can facilitate transparency (by making them known), and also promote accountability on the part of decision-makers. This work bridges this gap by means of a large-scale study that unearths the rationale behind decisions from Python development email archives comprising about 1.5 million emails. This paper makes two main contributions. First, it makes a knowledge contribution by unearthing and presenting the rationale behind decisions made. Second, it makes a methodological contribution by presenting a heuristics-based rationale extraction system called Rationale Miner that employs multiple heuristics, and follows a data-driven, bottom-up approach to infer the rationale behind specific decisions (e.g., whether a new module is implemented based on core developer consensus or benevolent dictator's pronouncement). Our approach can be applied to extract rationale in other OSSD communities that have similar governance structures.",0,Human
"Attempt to fully discover the temporal diversity and chronological characteristics for self-supervised video representation learning, this work takes advantage of the temporal dependencies within videos and further proposes a novel self-supervised method named Temporal Contrastive Graph Learning (TCGL). In contrast to the existing methods that ignore modeling elaborate temporal dependencies, our TCGL roots in a hybrid graph contrastive learning strategy to jointly regard the inter-snippet and intra-snippet temporal dependencies as self-supervision signals for temporal representation learning. To model multi-scale temporal dependencies, our TCGL integrates the prior knowledge about the frame and snippet orders into graph structures, i.e., the intra-/inter- snippet temporal contrastive graphs. By randomly removing edges and masking nodes of the intra-snippet graphs or inter-snippet graphs, our TCGL can generate different correlated graph views. Then, specific contrastive learning modules are designed to maximize the agreement between nodes in different views. To adaptively learn the global context representation and recalibrate the channel-wise features, we introduce an adaptive video snippet order prediction module, which leverages the relational knowledge among video snippets to predict the actual snippet orders. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our TCGL over the state-of-the-art methods on large-scale action recognition and video retrieval benchmarks.",0,Human

"This study introduces SCSGuard, an innovative deep learning method aimed at identifying scams within Ethereum smart contracts. Scamming is a major issue in the Ethereum environment, potentially leading to substantial monetary losses for users. Presently, most methods for spotting scams in smart contracts employ rule-based techniques or static analysis. In contrast, SCSGuard leverages a deep learning model to recognize irregularities in the bytecode of these contracts. To assess the efficacy of SCSGuard, we amassed a substantial dataset containing both known scams and non-scam contracts, and trained the model through supervised learning. We compared SCSGuard‚Äôs performance against multiple leading methods for detecting scams in smart contracts. The findings indicate that SCSGuard outperforms these methods in terms of accuracy and recall, suggesting its capability to reliably identify scams in practical smart contracts. Additionally, we explored the elements contributing to SCSGuard‚Äôs success, such as the selection of the neural network architecture, the quantity and quality of the training data, and the application of transfer learning to accommodate various scam types. We also acknowledged the limitations of SCSGuard, including challenges in model interpretation and the need for evaluating its resilience against adversarial examples.

"Public speaking is an important aspect of human communication and interaction. The majority of computational work on public speaking concentrates on analyzing the spoken content, and the verbal behavior of the speakers. While the success of public speaking largely depends on the content of the talk, and the verbal behavior, non-verbal (visual) cues, such as gestures and physical appearance also play a significant role. This paper investigates the importance of visual cues by estimating their contribution towards predicting the popularity of a public lecture. For this purpose, we constructed a large database of more than $1800$ TED talk videos. As a measure of popularity of the TED talks, we leverage the corresponding (online) viewers' ratings from YouTube. Visual cues related to facial and physical appearance, facial expressions, and pose variations are extracted from the video frames using convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Thereafter, an attention-based long short-term memory (LSTM) network is proposed to predict the video popularity from the sequence of visual features. The proposed network achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy indicating that visual cues alone contain highly predictive information about the popularity of a talk. Furthermore, our network learns a human-like attention mechanism, which is particularly useful for interpretability, i.e. how attention varies with time, and across different visual cues by indicating their relative importance.",0,Human

"Reinforcement learning has lead to considerable break-throughs in diverse areas such as robotics, games and many others. But the application to RL in complex real-world decision making problems remains limited. Many problems in operations management (inventory and revenue management, for example) are characterized by large action spaces and stochastic system dynamics. These characteristics make the problem considerably harder to solve for existing RL methods that rely on enumeration techniques to solve per step action problems. To resolve these issues, we develop Programmable Actor Reinforcement Learning (PARL), a policy iteration method that uses techniques from integer programming and sample average approximation. Analytically, we show that the for a given critic, the learned policy in each iteration converges to the optimal policy as the underlying samples of the uncertainty go to infinity. Practically, we show that a properly selected discretization of the underlying uncertain distribution can yield near optimal actor policy even with very few samples from the underlying uncertainty. We then apply our algorithm to real-world inventory management problems with complex supply chain structures and show that PARL outperforms state-of-the-art RL and inventory optimization methods in these settings. We find that PARL outperforms commonly used base stock heuristic by 44.7% and the best performing RL method by up to 12.1% on average across different supply chain environments.",0,Human
"Methods for neural network hyperparameter optimization and meta-modeling are computationally expensive due to the need to train a large number of model configurations. In this paper, we show that standard frequentist regression models can predict the final performance of partially trained model configurations using features based on network architectures, hyperparameters, and time-series validation performance data. We empirically show that our performance prediction models are much more effective than prominent Bayesian counterparts, are simpler to implement, and are faster to train. Our models can predict final performance in both visual classification and language modeling domains, are effective for predicting performance of drastically varying model architectures, and can even generalize between model classes. Using these prediction models, we also propose an early stopping method for hyperparameter optimization and meta-modeling, which obtains a speedup of a factor up to 6x in both hyperparameter optimization and meta-modeling. Finally, we empirically show that our early stopping method can be seamlessly incorporated into both reinforcement learning-based architecture selection algorithms and bandit based search methods. Through extensive experimentation, we empirically show our performance prediction models and early stopping algorithm are state-of-the-art in terms of prediction accuracy and speedup achieved while still identifying the optimal model configurations.",0,Human

We give efficient, fast, and practicable parallel algorithms for building data structures that support sampling single items (alias tables, compressed data structures). This also yields a simplified and more space-efficient sequential algorithm for alias table construction. Our approaches to sampling $k$ out of $n$ items with/without replacement and to subset (Poisson) sampling are output-sensitive, i.e., the sampling algorithms use work linear in the number of different samples. This is also interesting in the sequential case. Weighted random permutation can be done by sorting appropriate random deviates. We show that this is possible with linear work using a nonlinear transformation of these deviates. Finally, we give a communication-efficient, highly scalable approach to (weighted and unweighted) reservoir sampling. This algorithm is based on a fully distributed model of streaming algorithms that might be of independent interest. Experiments for alias tables and sampling with replacement show near linear speedups both for construction and queries using up to 158 threads of shared-memory machines. An experimental evaluation of distributed weighted reservoir sampling on up to 256 nodes (5120 cores) also shows good speedups.",0,Human
"Recently, barrier function-based safe reinforcement learning (RL) with the actor-critic structure for continuous control tasks has received increasing attention. It is still challenging to learn a near-optimal control policy with safety and convergence guarantees. Also, few works have addressed the safe RL algorithm design under time-varying safety constraints. This paper proposes a model-based safe RL algorithm for optimal control of nonlinear systems with time-varying state and control constraints. In the proposed approach, we construct a novel barrier-based control policy structure that can guarantee control safety. A multi-step policy evaluation mechanism is proposed to predict the policy's safety risk under time-varying safety constraints and guide the policy to update safely. Theoretical results on stability and robustness are proven. Also, the convergence of the actor-critic learning algorithm is analyzed. The performance of the proposed algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art RL algorithms in the simulated Safety Gym environment. Furthermore, the approach is applied to the integrated path following and collision avoidance problem for two real-world intelligent vehicles. A differential-drive vehicle and an Ackermann-drive one are used to verify the offline deployment performance and the online learning performance, respectively. Our approach shows an impressive sim-to-real transfer capability and a satisfactory online control performance in the experiment.",0,Human
"In quasi-proportional auctions, each bidder receives a fraction of the allocation equal to the weight of their bid divided by the sum of weights of all bids, where each bid's weight is determined by a weight function. We study the relationship between the weight function, bidders' private values, number of bidders, and the seller's revenue in equilibrium. It has been shown that if one bidder has a much higher private value than the others, then a nearly flat weight function maximizes revenue. Essentially, threatening the bidder who has the highest valuation with having to share the allocation maximizes the revenue. We show that as bidder private values approach parity, steeper weight functions maximize revenue by making the quasi-proportional auction more like a winner-take-all auction. We also show that steeper weight functions maximize revenue as the number of bidders increases. For flatter weight functions, there is known to be a unique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. We show that a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium also exists for steeper weight functions, and we give lower bounds for bids at an equilibrium. For a special case that includes the two-bidder auction, we show that the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium is unique, and we show how to compute the revenue at equilibrium. We also show that selecting a weight function based on private value ratios and number of bidders is necessary for a quasi-proportional auction to produce more revenue than a second-price auction.",0,Human
"Frequency estimation is crucial in many signal processing contexts. This study introduces a new technique for estimating frequencies with a one-sided error margin, a scenario where the estimate must fall within a defined boundary‚Äîeither above or below the actual value. Our approach leverages an enhanced periodogram alongside a statistical test. When compared against conventional frequency estimation techniques, our method shows superiority in terms of precision, reliability, and efficiency across multiple situations. This innovation will be especially useful for those engaged in signal processing projects where precise frequency estimation with a one-sided tolerance is essential.",1,AI
"The existence of tactile afferents sensitive to slip-related mechanical transients in the human hand augments the robustness of grasping through secondary force modulation protocols. Despite this knowledge and the fact that tactile-based slip detection has been researched for decades, robust slip detection is still not an out-of-the-box capability for any commercially available tactile sensor. This research seeks to bridge this gap with a comprehensive study addressing several aspects of slip detection. Key developments include a systematic data collection process yielding millions of sensory data points, the generalized conversion of multivariate-to-univariate sensor output, an insightful spectral analysis of the univariate sensor outputs, and the application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks on the univariate signals to produce robust slip detectors from three commercially available sensors capable of tactile sensing. The sensing elements underlying these sensors vary in quantity, spatial arrangement, and mechanics, leveraging principles in electro-mechanical resistance, optics, and hydro-acoustics. Critically, slip detection performance of the tactile technologies is quantified through a measurement methodology that unveils the effects of data window size, sampling rate, material type, slip speed, and sensor manufacturing variability. Results indicate that the investigated commercial tactile sensors are inherently capable of high-quality slip detection.",0,Human
"Egocentric action anticipation is the task of predicting the future actions a camera wearer will likely perform based on past video observations. While in a real-world system it is fundamental to output such predictions before the action begins, past works have not generally paid attention to model runtime during evaluation. Indeed, current evaluation schemes assume that predictions can be made offline, and hence that computational resources are not limited. In contrast, in this paper, we propose a ``streaming'' egocentric action anticipation evaluation protocol which explicitly considers model runtime for performance assessment, assuming that predictions will be available only after the current video segment is processed, which depends on the processing time of a method. Following the proposed evaluation scheme, we benchmark different state-of-the-art approaches for egocentric action anticipation on two popular datasets. Our analysis shows that models with a smaller runtime tend to outperform heavier models in the considered streaming scenario, thus changing the rankings generally observed in standard offline evaluations. Based on this observation, we propose a lightweight action anticipation model consisting in a simple feed-forward 3D CNN, which we propose to optimize using knowledge distillation techniques and a custom loss. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms prior art in the streaming scenario, also in combination with other lightweight models.",0,Human
"Over the past few years, 5G technology has emerged as a vital component of wireless communication networks, offering high-speed data transfer and lower latency. The growing demand for 5G services in crowded urban areas has spurred the need for efficient strategies to choose the right radio access technologies (RATs) for these networks. This paper examines the critical elements that affect RAT selection for dense 5G wireless networks, including network architecture, network density, available spectrum, and user demands. A novel method for RAT selection is introduced, which uses machine learning algorithms to forecast the best RAT for specific scenarios by considering real-time network conditions. The method takes into account several indicators like network traffic, interference levels, and network coverage to make informed choices. This innovative approach has been tested using simulations and experiments, demonstrating its superiority over traditional methods in terms of network performance and user satisfaction. This research sheds light on the complexities involved in selecting RATs for 5G dense networks and suggests a promising strategy for network operators and designers to enhance network efficiency and improve user experiences. The proposed technique is anticipated to significantly influence the evolution of 5G networks and advance the realm of wireless communication systems.",1,AI
"Quora is a popular Q&A site which provides users with the ability to tag questions with multiple relevant topics which helps to attract quality answers. These topics are not predefined but user-defined conventions and it is not so rare to have multiple such conventions present in the Quora ecosystem describing exactly the same concept. In almost all such cases, users (or Quora moderators) manually merge the topic pair into one of the either topics, thus selecting one of the competing conventions. An important application for the site therefore is to identify such competing conventions early enough that should merge in future. In this paper, we propose a two-step approach that uniquely combines the anomaly detection and the supervised classification frameworks to predict whether two topics from among millions of topic pairs are indeed competing conventions, and should merge, achieving an F-score of 0.711. We also develop a model to predict the direction of the topic merge, i.e., the winning convention, achieving an F-score of 0.898. Our system is also able to predict ~ 25% of the correct case of merges within the first month of the merge and ~ 40% of the cases within a year. This is an encouraging result since Quora users on average take 936 days to identify such a correct merge. Human judgment experiments show that our system is able to predict almost all the correct cases that humans can predict plus 37.24% correct cases which the humans are not able to identify at all.",0,Human

As systems expand in size and intricacy, maintaining these acid properties becomes challenging. The research suggests employing operation partitioning as a strategy to enhance scalability, offering better performance and higher reliability. To test this idea, the study implemented operation partitioning in an actual acid application, examining its effects on key performance indicators. The findings show that operation partitioning is a viable solution for scaling acid applications, providing enhanced performance and reliability while preserving the critical acid characteristics.",1,AI
"Graph neural networks (GNN) have been proven to be mature enough for handling graph-structured data on node-level graph representation learning tasks. However, the graph pooling technique for learning expressive graph-level representation is critical yet still challenging. Existing pooling methods either struggle to capture the local substructure or fail to effectively utilize high-order dependency, thus diminishing the expression capability. In this paper we propose HAP, a hierarchical graph-level representation learning framework, which is adaptively sensitive to graph structures, i.e., HAP clusters local substructures incorporating with high-order dependencies. HAP utilizes a novel cross-level attention mechanism MOA to naturally focus more on close neighborhood while effectively capture higher-order dependency that may contain crucial information. It also learns a global graph content GCont that extracts the graph pattern properties to make the pre- and post-coarsening graph content maintain stable, thus providing global guidance in graph coarsening. This novel innovation also facilitates generalization across graphs with the same form of features. Extensive experiments on fourteen datasets show that HAP significantly outperforms twelve popular graph pooling methods on graph classification task with an maximum accuracy improvement of 22.79%, and exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art graph matching and graph similarity learning algorithms by over 3.5% and 16.7%.",0,Human
"This study introduces an innovative method for enhancing the performance of cooperative dual-band UAV swarms by optimizing their flight paths. The proposed technique makes use of the distinctive features of dual-band UAVs, capable of operating across two distinct frequency bands at once, to boost the swarm's communication and sensory abilities. The optimization problem for the UAV swarms is framed as a multi-objective optimization challenge that takes into account various goals such as reducing the total duration of the mission, minimizing the energy usage of the drones, and maximizing the efficiency of the communication and sensing connections among the drones. A genetic algorithm is employed to identify the best flight paths that align with these objectives. The research showcases simulation outcomes that validate the efficacy of the proposed solution in improving the performance of the cooperative dual-band UAV swarm. These simulations indicate that the proposed method can substantially decrease the mission duration and energy expenditure, all while enhancing the quality of the communication and sensory links. Additionally, the paper outlines the real-world applicability of the proposed strategy and suggests potential avenues for further investigation. In summary, this work advances the understanding of cooperative UAV swarms and offers a viable path for optimizing dual-band UAV trajectories in practical scenarios.",1,AI
"A fundamental problem in neuroscience is to characterize the dynamics of spiking from the neurons in a circuit that is involved in learning about a stimulus or a contingency. A key limitation of current methods to analyze neural spiking data is the need to collapse neural activity over time or trials, which may cause the loss of information pertinent to understanding the function of a neuron or circuit. We introduce a new method that can determine not only the trial-to-trial dynamics that accompany the learning of a contingency by a neuron, but also the latency of this learning with respect to the onset of a conditioned stimulus. The backbone of the method is a separable two-dimensional (2D) random field (RF) model of neural spike rasters, in which the joint conditional intensity function of a neuron over time and trials depends on two latent Markovian state sequences that evolve separately but in parallel. Classical tools to estimate state-space models cannot be applied readily to our 2D separable RF model. We develop efficient statistical and computational tools to estimate the parameters of the separable 2D RF model. We apply these to data collected from neurons in the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) in an experiment designed to characterize the neural underpinnings of the associative learning of fear in mice. Overall, the separable 2D RF model provides a detailed, interpretable, characterization of the dynamics of neural spiking that accompany the learning of a contingency.",0,Human

"Most distributed-memory bulk-synchronous parallel programs in HPC assume that compute resources are available continuously and homogeneously across the allocated set of compute nodes. However, long one-off delays on individual processes can cause global disturbances, so-called idle waves, by rippling through the system. This process is mainly governed by the communication topology of the underlying parallel code. This paper makes significant contributions to the understanding of idle wave dynamics. We study the propagation mechanisms of idle waves across the ranks of MPI-parallel programs. We present a validated analytic model for their propagation velocity with respect to communication parameters and topology, with a special emphasis on sparse communication patterns. We study the interaction of idle waves with MPI collectives and show that, depending on the implementation, a collective may be transparent to the wave. Finally we analyze two mechanisms of idle wave decay: topological decay, which is rooted in differences in communication characteristics among parts of the system, and noise-induced decay, which is caused by system or application noise. We show that noise-induced decay is largely independent of noise characteristics but depends only on the overall noise power. An analytic expression for idle wave decay rate with respect to noise power is derived. For model validation we use microbenchmarks and stencil algorithms on three different supercomputing platforms.",0,Human
"With YouTube becoming more popular for sharing content, there are growing concerns about the potential dangers it could pose to children, especially when they come across inappropriate or harmful material.

Additionally, we looked at how promoters manipulate children‚Äôs emotions or beliefs to gain profit, often using deceptive advertisements and manipulating search results. Our research provides valuable information on the frequency of child-unfriendly content on YouTube, the ways promoters attract young viewers, and the possible consequences on children‚Äôs mental health. The research underscores the necessity for enhanced detection and removal of harmful content, as well as stricter control over advertising methods on the platform to safeguard children from potential harm.",1,AI
"Subgraph queries also known as subgraph isomorphism search is a fundamental problem in querying graph-like structured data. It consists to enumerate the subgraphs of a data graph that match a query graph. This problem arises in many real-world applications related to query processing or pattern recognition such as computer vision, social network analysis, bioinformatic and big data analytic. Subgraph isomorphism search knows a lot of investigations and solutions mainly because of its importance and use but also because of its NP-completeness. Existing solutions use filtering mechanisms and optimise the order within witch the query vertices are matched on the data vertices to obtain acceptable processing times. However, existing approaches are iterative and generate several intermediate results. They also require that the data graph is loaded in main memory and consequently are not adapted to large graphs that do not fit into memory or are accessed by streams. To tackle this problem, we propose a new approach based on concepts widely different from existing works. Our approach distills the semantic and topological information that surround a vertex into a simple integer. This simple vertex encoding that can be computed and updated incrementally reduces considerably intermediate results and avoid to load the entire data graph into main memory. We evaluate our approach on several real-word datasets. The experimental results show that our approach is efficient and scalable.",0,Human
"This study looks at how political discussions on Twitter evolved from 2014 to 2019, analyzing trends through Twitter data. It reveals that Twitter has become a crucial space for political discourse, with more people engaging in these conversations. The research also shows that the type of political talk has shifted, with discussions becoming more divided and the atmosphere more confrontational. The findings suggest that these changes on Twitter mirror broader shifts in politics, as more people use social media to express their views and participate in political conversations. The paper underscores the significance of tracking these changes in political discussions online and emphasizes the ongoing need for research to comprehend how these shifts influence political dialogue and democracy.",1,AI
"This study introduces a new method called SRGRAND for decoding in communication systems. Unlike traditional techniques, which solely depend on channel state information (CSI) for decoding, SRGRAND uses both CSI and symbol reliability data to boost performance. Symbol reliability is determined by analyzing the statistical characteristics of the transmitted symbols and the noise present in the channel. This extra information helps determine the quality of each symbol, which is then utilized to refine the decoding process. As a result, simulations demonstrate that SRGRAND performs better than existing methods and offers greater resilience in real-world communication scenarios.",1,AI
"We present a path planning framework that takes into account the human's safety perception in the presence of a flying robot. The framework addresses two objectives: (i) estimation of the uncertain parameters of the proposed safety perception model based on test data collected using Virtual Reality (VR) testbed, and (ii) offline optimal control computation using the estimated safety perception model. Due to the unknown factors in the human tests data, it is not suitable to use standard regression techniques that minimize the mean squared error (MSE). We propose to use a Hidden Markov model (HMM) approach where human's attention is considered as a hidden state to infer whether the data samples are relevant to learn the safety perception model. The HMM approach improved log-likelihood over the standard least squares solution. For path planning, we use Bernstein polynomials for discretization, as the resulting path remains within the convex hull of the control points, providing guarantees for deconfliction with obstacles at low computational cost. An example of optimal trajectory generation using the learned human model is presented. The optimal trajectory generated using the proposed model results in reasonable safety distance from the human. In contrast, the paths generated using the standard regression model have undesirable shapes due to overfitting. The example demonstrates that the HMM approach has robustness to the unknown factors compared to the standard MSE model.",0,Human
"This study examines the difficulty and potential solutions for the probabilistic p-center problem, considering various pressures. The p-center problem is a common issue in operations research and computer science, focusing on placing p facilities within a network so that the longest distance from any point to its nearest facility is as small as possible. The probabilistic p-center problem broadens this by taking into account how demands at different points might vary according to a probability distribution. The 'pressure' aspect refers to any limiting conditions or external influences that might impact the decision-making process. Initially, the paper introduces the probabilistic p-center problem along with its variations, specifically the classical and pressure-sensitive versions. It then investigates the computational challenges of solving this problem, demonstrating its NP-hard nature through transformations from other known NP-hard problems. The paper also offers approximation methods for dealing with the probabilistic p-center problem under pressure, evaluating their efficiency and offering examples with numerical data to show their practicality. Lastly, the study concludes by highlighting the main findings and suggesting areas for further exploration. These findings offer crucial knowledge about the complexities and approximations involved in the probabilistic p-center problem under pressure, serving as an important resource for professionals and academics in the fields of operations research and computer science.",1,AI
"This research investigates how self-supervised learning can enhance the representation of tabular data. Current methods often rely on manually crafted features or pre-existing embeddings, which might miss the data's true structure. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that utilizes the intrinsic structure of tables to generate more insightful representations. We design two self-supervised tasks aimed at predicting missing entries and restoring damaged tables. Our experiments on various real-world datasets validate the superiority of our method over conventional approaches for tabular data representation. The results indicate that self-supervised learning could be a valuable strategy for better understanding tabular data and boosting performance in tasks like classification and regression.",1,AI
"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to solve the problem of knowledge transfer from labeled source domain to unlabeled target domain. Recently, many domain adaptation (DA) methods use centroid to align the local distribution of different domains, that is, to align different classes. This improves the effect of domain adaptation, but domain differences exist not only between classes, but also between samples. This work rethinks what is the alignment between different domains, and studies how to achieve the real alignment between different domains. Previous DA methods only considered one distribution feature of aligned samples, such as full distribution or local distribution. In addition to aligning the global distribution, the real domain adaptation should also align the meso distribution and the micro distribution. Therefore, this study propose a double classifier method based on high confidence label (DCP). By aligning the centroid and the distribution between centroid and sample of different classifiers, the meso and micro distribution alignment of different domains is realized. In addition, in order to reduce the chain error caused by error marking, This study propose a high confidence marking method to reduce the marking error. To verify its versatility, this study evaluates DCP on digital recognition and target recognition data sets. The results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on most of the current domain adaptation benchmark datasets.",0,Human

"In Knowledge Representation, it is crucial that knowledge engineers have a good understanding of the formal expressions that they write. What formal expressions state intuitively about the domain of discourse is studied in the theory of the informal semantics of a logic. In this paper we study the informal semantics of Answer Set Programming. The roots of answer set programming lie in the language of Extended Logic Programming, which was introduced initially as an epistemic logic for default and autoepistemic reasoning. In 1999, the seminal papers on answer set programming proposed to use this logic for a different purpose, namely, to model and solve search problems. Currently, the language is used primarily in this new role. However, the original epistemic intuitions lose their explanatory relevance in this new context. How answer set programs are connected to the specifications of problems they model is more easily explained in a classical Tarskian semantics, in which models correspond to possible worlds, rather than to belief states of an epistemic agent. In this paper, we develop a new theory of the informal semantics of answer set programming, which is formulated in the Tarskian setting and based on Frege's compositionality principle. It differs substantially from the earlier epistemic theory of informal semantics, providing a different view on the meaning of the connectives in answer set programming and on its relation to other logics, in particular classical logic.",0,Human
"The application of reinforcement learning algorithms onto real life problems always bears the challenge of filtering the environmental state out of raw sensor readings. While most approaches use heuristics, biology suggests that there must exist an unsupervised method to construct such filters automatically. Besides the extraction of environmental states, the filters have to represent them in a fashion that support modern reinforcement algorithms. Many popular algorithms use a linear architecture, so one should aim at filters that have good approximation properties in combination with linear functions. This thesis wants to propose the unsupervised method slow feature analysis (SFA) for this task. Presented with a random sequence of sensor readings, SFA learns a set of filters. With growing model complexity and training examples, the filters converge against trigonometric polynomial functions. These are known to possess excellent approximation capabilities and should therfore support the reinforcement algorithms well. We evaluate this claim on a robot. The task is to learn a navigational control in a simple environment using the least square policy iteration (LSPI) algorithm. The only accessible sensor is a head mounted video camera, but without meaningful filtering, video images are not suited as LSPI input. We will show that filters learned by SFA, based on a random walk video of the robot, allow the learned control to navigate successfully in ca. 80% of the test trials.",0,Human
"This research introduces a deep learning method for identifying Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks within Internet of Things (IoT) networks.

"The success of deep learning in vision can be attributed to: (a) models with high capacity; (b) increased computational power; and (c) availability of large-scale labeled data. Since 2012, there have been significant advances in representation capabilities of the models and computational capabilities of GPUs. But the size of the biggest dataset has surprisingly remained constant. What will happen if we increase the dataset size by 10x or 100x? This paper takes a step towards clearing the clouds of mystery surrounding the relationship between `enormous data' and visual deep learning. By exploiting the JFT-300M dataset which has more than 375M noisy labels for 300M images, we investigate how the performance of current vision tasks would change if this data was used for representation learning. Our paper delivers some surprising (and some expected) findings. First, we find that the performance on vision tasks increases logarithmically based on volume of training data size. Second, we show that representation learning (or pre-training) still holds a lot of promise. One can improve performance on many vision tasks by just training a better base model. Finally, as expected, we present new state-of-the-art results for different vision tasks including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and human pose estimation. Our sincere hope is that this inspires vision community to not undervalue the data and develop collective efforts in building larger datasets.",0,Human
"This research examines how consensus-based distributed filtering works in a network of connected agents. The goal is to predict a shared signal using individual measurements that are spread across the network. Our method involves creating a distributed filtering algorithm based on consensus theory, wherein each node updates its prediction by integrating its own data with information from its neighbors. Additionally, there's a fusion phase where these local predictions are merged to form an overall signal estimate. We explore the convergence of our algorithm and establish criteria for reaching a consensus estimate. Furthermore, we look into how the fusion process impacts the precision of the final prediction and calculate potential error limits. To showcase the algorithm's effectiveness, we conduct simulations showing it can accurately gauge the signal in both noisy and ever-changing scenarios. This technique has practical applications in areas like sensor networks, distributed control systems, and multi-agent setups, where precise estimation of a common signal is necessary.",1,AI

"The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) serves as a robust tool in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for simulating fluid flow by addressing the Boltzmann equation. This paper introduces an innovative way to accelerate LBM on non-uniform grids through massive parallelism. Unlike uniform grids, which offer flexibility but are difficult to distribute across multiple compute nodes, non-uniform grids provide better resolution for intricate shapes. However, these grids have posed challenges in terms of parallelization. Our strategy leverages the data-parallel characteristics of the LBM to distribute calculations across various computing nodes efficiently. We employ a mixed MPI/OpenMP technique when implementing the LBM on non-uniform grids, aiming to optimize both computational workload and communication expenses. The efficacy of our implementation has been validated through a series of benchmark tests, comparing favorably against other parallel approaches. Our findings indicate that our parallelized algorithm performs well up to a high number of compute nodes, delivering substantial gains in speed compared to current methods, thus proving the practicality of our technique for tackling complex CFD simulations on a grand scale.",1,AI
"We present theory and algorithms for the computation of probability-weighted ""keep-out"" sets to assure probabilistically safe navigation in the presence of multiple rigid body obstacles with stochastic dynamics. Our forward stochastic reachability-based approach characterizes the stochasticity of the future obstacle states in a grid-free and recursion-free manner, using Fourier transforms and computational geometry. We consider discrete-time Markovian switched systems with affine parameter-varying stochastic subsystems (DMSP) as the obstacle dynamics, which includes Markov jump affine systems and discrete-time affine parameter-varying stochastic systems (DPV). We define a probabilistic occupancy function, to describe the probability that a given state is occupied by a rigid body obstacle with stochastic dynamics at a given time; keep-out sets are the super-level sets of this occupancy function. We provide sufficient conditions that ensure convexity and compactness of these keep-out sets for DPV obstacle dynamics. We also propose two computationally efficient algorithms to overapproximate the keep-out sets --- a tight polytopic approximation using projections, and an overapproximation using Minkowski sum. For DMSP obstacle dynamics, we compute a union of convex and compact sets that covers the potentially non-convex keep-out set. Numerical simulations show the efficacy of the proposed algorithms for a modified version of the classical unicycle dynamics, modeled as a DMSP.",0,Human
"Ride-hailing apps have gained popularity in numerous cities worldwide. In Nigeria, ORide stands out as a significant player providing inexpensive transportation options to city dwellers. However, the mystery surrounding ORide drivers has been a persistent issue that raises questions about user safety and trust. For this reason, we conducted a study examining how users perceive driver anonymity and its effects on safety. Using a survey of 500 ORide users from Lagos, we explored their opinions on driver anonymity and what factors drive them to utilize the service. Our results indicate that many users are apprehensive about driver anonymity and want more details about their drivers, including their names and pictures. Moreover, users' views on driver anonymity are influenced by their previous experiences with the app, gender, and age. Furthermore, our research highlights potential safety risks associated with driver anonymity, like the challenge of identifying drivers during accidents or security incidents. Based on these findings, we suggest strategies for ORide and similar services to tackle the anonymity issue while prioritizing user safety and privacy. This study adds to the discourse on ride-hailing services in developing nations and underscores the need for finding a balance between user confidentiality and safety.",1,AI
"This research introduces an innovative way to handle epistemic uncertainty through Bayesian confidence calibration. Epistemic uncertainty occurs due to insufficient knowledge or understanding of a system, leading to potential errors in predictions. While Bayesian methods are commonly employed to tackle this issue, they sometimes exhibit overconfidence when the model assumptions are incorrect or when there's a scarcity of data. To tackle these challenges, we present a novel approach grounded in Bayesian confidence calibration, designed to improve the accuracy of uncertainty estimates generated by Bayesian models. Our strategy involves developing a calibration function that fine-tunes the uncertainty predictions made by the Bayesian model, taking into account both the data's reliability and the extent of model misfit. We validate our technique using both simulated and actual datasets and contrast its performance against other prevalent approaches for managing epistemic uncertainty. The outcomes indicate that our method yields more precise and dependable uncertainty assessments, which are crucial for informed decision-making under uncertain conditions. Finally, we explore the practical implications of our method across diverse fields such as finance, engineering, and healthcare.",1,AI

"This research introduces an innovative motion planning method named e$ \mathbf{^3} $mop, which integrates motion primitives pruning guided by heuristics and path optimization with a sparse-banded framework. The algorithm is tailored to tackle intricate motion planning challenges, especially in robotic and autonomous systems. Initially, e$ \mathbf{^3} $mop creates a collection of motion primitives under heuristic guidance to minimize the search space.

"The datasets of face recognition contain an enormous number of identities and instances. However, conventional methods have difficulty in reflecting the entire distribution of the datasets because a mini-batch of small size contains only a small portion of all identities. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a novel method called BroadFace, which is a learning process to consider a massive set of identities, comprehensively. In BroadFace, a linear classifier learns optimal decision boundaries among identities from a large number of embedding vectors accumulated over past iterations. By referring more instances at once, the optimality of the classifier is naturally increased on the entire datasets. Thus, the encoder is also globally optimized by referring the weight matrix of the classifier. Moreover, we propose a novel compensation method to increase the number of referenced instances in the training stage. BroadFace can be easily applied on many existing methods to accelerate a learning process and obtain a significant improvement in accuracy without extra computational burden at inference stage. We perform extensive ablation studies and experiments on various datasets to show the effectiveness of BroadFace, and also empirically prove the validity of our compensation method. BroadFace achieves the state-of-the-art results with significant improvements on nine datasets in 1:1 face verification and 1:N face identification tasks, and is also effective in image retrieval.",0,Human
"Temporal pattern mining is essential in areas like finance, health, and engineering, where continuous streams of time series data are produced. Traditional techniques for mining temporal patterns often struggle with big datasets, leading to high computational demands. Mutual information, which helps quantify the relationship between variables, has proven useful in reducing the complexity of data by focusing on key features. This paper introduces an efficient method for handling big time series data through mutual information. Our strategy involves three phases: data preprocessing, feature selection based on mutual information, and temporal pattern extraction. During preprocessing, we eliminate redundant data points and standardize the remaining data. Feature selection then uses mutual information to identify the most pertinent features. Lastly, we employ a modified PrefixSpan algorithm for extracting frequent temporal patterns from these selected features. We validate our approach using real-world datasets across multiple domains, comparing it favorably against current best practices. Our results indicate superior performance in both speed and precision compared to existing solutions, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional data.

"Fog radio access networks (F-RANs), which consist of a cloud and multiple edge nodes (ENs) connected via fronthaul links, have been regarded as promising network architectures. The F-RAN entails a joint optimization of cloud and edge computing as well as fronthaul interactions, which is challenging for traditional optimization techniques. This paper proposes a Cloud-Enabled Cooperation-Inspired Learning (CECIL) framework, a structural deep learning mechanism for handling a generic F-RAN optimization problem. The proposed solution mimics cloud-aided cooperative optimization policies by including centralized computing at the cloud, distributed decision at the ENs, and their uplink-downlink fronthaul interactions. A group of deep neural networks (DNNs) are employed for characterizing computations of the cloud and ENs. The forwardpass of the DNNs is carefully designed such that the impacts of the practical fronthaul links, such as channel noise and signling overheads, can be included in a training step. As a result, operations of the cloud and ENs can be jointly trained in an end-to-end manner, whereas their real-time inferences are carried out in a decentralized manner by means of the fronthaul coordination. To facilitate fronthaul cooperation among multiple ENs, the optimal fronthaul multiple access schemes are designed. Training algorithms robust to practical fronthaul impairments are also presented. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.",0,Human

"The goal of this paper is to establish which practical routing schemes for wireless networks are most suitable for wideband systems in the power-limited regime, which is, for example, a practically relevant mode of operation for the analysis of ultrawideband (UWB) mesh networks. For this purpose, we study the tradeoff between energy efficiency and spectral efficiency (known as the power-bandwidth tradeoff) in a wideband linear multihop network in which transmissions employ orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation and are affected by quasi-static, frequency-selective fading. Considering open-loop (fixed-rate) and closed-loop (rate-adaptive) multihop relaying techniques, we characterize the impact of routing with spatial reuse on the statistical properties of the end-to-end conditional mutual information (conditioned on the specific values of the channel fading parameters and therefore treated as a random variable) and on the energy and spectral efficiency measures of the wideband regime. Our analysis particularly deals with the convergence of these end-to-end performance measures in the case of large number of hops, i.e., the phenomenon first observed in \cite{Oyman06b} and named as ``multihop diversity''. Our results demonstrate the realizability of the multihop diversity advantages in the case of routing with spatial reuse for wideband OFDM systems under wireless channel effects such as path-loss and quasi-static frequency-selective multipath fading.",0,Human

"Automatic segmentation methods are an important advancement in medical image analysis. Machine learning techniques, and deep neural networks in particular, are the state-of-the-art for most medical image segmentation tasks. Issues with class imbalance pose a significant challenge in medical datasets, with lesions often occupying a considerably smaller volume relative to the background. Loss functions used in the training of deep learning algorithms differ in their robustness to class imbalance, with direct consequences for model convergence. The most commonly used loss functions for segmentation are based on either the cross entropy loss, Dice loss or a combination of the two. We propose the Unified Focal loss, a new hierarchical framework that generalises Dice and cross entropy-based losses for handling class imbalance. We evaluate our proposed loss function on five publicly available, class imbalanced medical imaging datasets: CVC-ClinicDB, Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE), Breast Ultrasound 2017 (BUS2017), Brain Tumour Segmentation 2020 (BraTS20) and Kidney Tumour Segmentation 2019 (KiTS19). We compare our loss function performance against six Dice or cross entropy-based loss functions, across 2D binary, 3D binary and 3D multiclass segmentation tasks, demonstrating that our proposed loss function is robust to class imbalance and consistently outperforms the other loss functions.

"This research examines how common and what functions heterogeneous network motifs serve in complex systems. Typically, studies focus on uniform network motifs where each node in the motif performs the same function. However, many real-world networks consist of nodes with varying functions and characteristics. In this study, we propose a technique to identify these heterogeneous motifs within networks and examine their frequency across various real-world systems, such as biological, social, and technological networks. Our investigation shows that heterogeneous motifs occur much more frequently than homogeneous ones in many real-world settings. These motifs are crucial for processes like information processing and regulation. We discover that many of these motifs are essential for organizing networks into modules, facilitating signal transmission, and maintaining regulatory feedback loops. Additionally, we observe that certain heterogeneous motifs appear repeatedly across diverse systems, indicating they might be fundamental components of complex networks. The findings from this research hold significant implications for system design and comprehension. By considering the roles of heterogeneous motifs, we can uncover the underlying mechanisms governing the behavior of real-world systems and devise better ways to control and manipulate them. Furthermore, the methodology we developed for detecting heterogeneous motifs can be applied to numerous types of networks, helping us to better understand the intricate relationship between network architecture and functionality in complex systems.",1,AI
"The study delves into the application of two metrics‚ÄîVideo Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF) and Entropic Differences (ED)‚Äîfor assessing the quality of high frame rate (HFR) videos. Given the rise in popularity of HFR videos, there's a need for dependable techniques to gauge their visual quality. While VMAF and ED have been widely utilized in traditional frame rates, their effectiveness in evaluating HFR videos hasn't been thoroughly explored. To assess these metrics' applicability, the researchers conducted subjective evaluations involving 30 participants using the Absolute Category Rating (ACR) method. These participants rated HFR video sequences, and their scores were compared against those derived from the VMAF and ED metrics. The study employed a variety of HFR videos from different genres and motion characteristics to validate its outcomes. The research revealed that both VMAF and ED are effective for HFR video quality assessment, showing a strong correlation with the subjective ratings provided by the ACR methodology. It was observed that VMAF outperformed ED marginally, although the difference wasn't statistically significant. This study advances the development of objective methods for assessing the visual quality of HFR videos, which can be beneficial for applications like video compression and streaming. Furthermore, the insights gained from this investigation can help in refining quality assessment algorithms tailored specifically for HFR video content.",1,AI

To evaluate its efficacy, the proposed method was tested on various benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to current leading approaches in both objective measurements and visual quality. Additionally, the computational efficiency of the proposed technique ensures it can seamlessly integrate into existing point cloud compression systems. These findings could greatly advance the field of efficient and high-quality point cloud compression.",1,AI
"We introduce a flexible, scalable Bayesian inference framework for nonlinear dynamical systems characterised by distinct and hierarchical variability at the individual, group, and population levels. Our model class is a generalisation of nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) dynamical systems, the statistical workhorse for many experimental sciences. We cast parameter inference as stochastic optimisation of an end-to-end differentiable, block-conditional variational autoencoder. We specify the dynamics of the data-generating process as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) such that both the ODE and its solver are fully differentiable. This model class is highly flexible: the ODE right-hand sides can be a mixture of user-prescribed or ""white-box"" sub-components and neural network or ""black-box"" sub-components. Using stochastic optimisation, our amortised inference algorithm could seamlessly scale up to massive data collection pipelines (common in labs with robotic automation). Finally, our framework supports interpretability with respect to the underlying dynamics, as well as predictive generalization to unseen combinations of group components (also called ""zero-shot"" learning). We empirically validate our method by predicting the dynamic behaviour of bacteria that were genetically engineered to function as biosensors.

"Human pose estimation is a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision, which aims at localizing human anatomical keypoints. However, unlike human vision that is robust to various data corruptions such as blur and pixelation, current pose estimators are easily confused by these corruptions. This work comprehensively studies and addresses this problem by building rigorous robust benchmarks, termed COCO-C, MPII-C, and OCHuman-C, to evaluate the weaknesses of current advanced pose estimators, and a new algorithm termed AdvMix is proposed to improve their robustness in different corruptions. Our work has several unique benefits. (1) AdvMix is model-agnostic and capable in a wide-spectrum of pose estimation models. (2) AdvMix consists of adversarial augmentation and knowledge distillation. Adversarial augmentation contains two neural network modules that are trained jointly and competitively in an adversarial manner, where a generator network mixes different corrupted images to confuse a pose estimator, improving the robustness of the pose estimator by learning from harder samples. To compensate for the noise patterns by adversarial augmentation, knowledge distillation is applied to transfer clean pose structure knowledge to the target pose estimator. (3) Extensive experiments show that AdvMix significantly increases the robustness of pose estimations across a wide range of corruptions, while maintaining accuracy on clean data in various challenging benchmark datasets.",0,Human
"The paper introduces a groundbreaking method for training multitask multilingual models that are highly scalable and efficient. These models are gaining traction in natural language processing because they can manage multiple languages and tasks concurrently. Yet, traditional training methods for these models tend to be lengthy and resource-intensive, thus constraining their practical use. To address this issue, the proposed strategy makes use of multi-node distributed training and adaptive optimization techniques to speed up training duration and minimize memory requirements.

"Manipulating facial expressions is a challenging task due to fine-grained shape changes produced by facial muscles and the lack of input-output pairs for supervised learning. Unlike previous methods using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), which rely on cycle-consistency loss or sparse geometry (landmarks) loss for expression synthesis, we propose a novel GAN framework to exploit 3D dense (depth and surface normals) information for expression manipulation. However, a large-scale dataset containing RGB images with expression annotations and their corresponding depth maps is not available. To this end, we propose to use an off-the-shelf state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction model to estimate the depth and create a large-scale RGB-Depth dataset after a manual data clean-up process. We utilise this dataset to minimise the novel depth consistency loss via adversarial learning (note we do not have ground truth depth maps for generated face images) and the depth categorical loss of synthetic data on the discriminator. In addition, to improve the generalisation and lower the bias of the depth parameters, we propose to use a novel confidence regulariser on the discriminator side of the framework. We extensively performed both quantitative and qualitative evaluations on two publicly available challenging facial expression benchmarks: AffectNet and RaFD. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the competitive baseline and existing arts by a large margin.",0,Human

"In this work, we initiate the study of \emph{smoothed analysis} of population protocols. We consider a population protocol model where an adaptive adversary dictates the interactions between agents, but with probability $p$ every such interaction may change into an interaction between two agents chosen uniformly at random. That is, $p$-fraction of the interactions are random, while $(1-p)$-fraction are adversarial. The aim of our model is to bridge the gap between a uniformly random scheduler (which is too idealistic) and an adversarial scheduler (which is too strict).  We focus on the fundamental problem of leader election in population protocols. We show that, for a population of size $n$, the leader election problem can be solved in $O(p^{-2}n \log^3 n)$ steps with high probability, using $O((\log^2 n) \cdot (\log (n/p)))$ states per agent, for \emph{all} values of $p\leq 1$. Although our result does not match the best known running time of $O(n \log n)$ for the uniformly random scheduler ($p=1$), we are able to present a \emph{smooth transition} between a running time of $O(n \cdot \mathrm{polylog} n)$ for $p=1$ and an infinite running time for the adversarial scheduler ($p=0$), where the problem cannot be solved. The key technical contribution of our work is a novel \emph{phase clock} algorithm for our model. This is a key primitive for much-studied fundamental population protocol algorithms (leader election, majority), and we believe it is of independent interest.",0,Human

Subsequently, a graph clustering algorithm is employed to discern groups of similarly structured data points. Following this, representatives are chosen within these clusters by measuring the geodesic Grassmann manifold distances between pairs of data points and selecting the one nearest to the average of the cluster within the manifold.

"Ramsey's theorem, in the version of Erd\H{o}s and Szekeres, states that every 2-coloring of the edges of the complete graph on {1, 2,...,n} contains a monochromatic clique of order 1/2\log n. In this paper, we consider two well-studied extensions of Ramsey's theorem.  Improving a result of R\""odl, we show that there is a constant $c>0$ such that every 2-coloring of the edges of the complete graph on \{2, 3,...,n\} contains a monochromatic clique S for which the sum of 1/\log i over all vertices i \in S is at least c\log\log\log n. This is tight up to the constant factor c and answers a question of Erd\H{o}s from 1981.  Motivated by a problem in model theory, V\""a\""an\""anen asked whether for every k there is an n such that the following holds. For every permutation \pi of 1,...,k-1, every 2-coloring of the edges of the complete graph on {1, 2, ..., n} contains a monochromatic clique a_1<...<a_k with a_{\pi(1)+1}-a_{\pi(1)}>a_{\pi(2)+1}-a_{\pi(2)}>...>a_{\pi(k-1)+1}-a_{\pi(k-1)}. That is, not only do we want a monochromatic clique, but the differences between consecutive vertices must satisfy a prescribed order. Alon and, independently, Erd\H{o}s, Hajnal and Pach answered this question affirmatively. Alon further conjectured that the true growth rate should be exponential in k. We make progress towards this conjecture, obtaining an upper bound on n which is exponential in a power of k. This improves a result of Shelah, who showed that n is at most double-exponential in k.",0,Human
"Software cost estimation is one of the prerequisite managerial activities carried out at the software development initiation stages and also repeated throughout the whole software life-cycle so that amendments to the total cost are made. In software cost estimation typically, a selection of project attributes is employed to produce effort estimations of the expected human resources to deliver a software product. However, choosing the appropriate project cost drivers in each case requires a lot of experience and knowledge on behalf of the project manager which can only be obtained through years of software engineering practice. A number of studies indicate that popular methods applied in the literature for software cost estimation, such as linear regression, are not robust enough and do not yield accurate predictions. Recently the dual variables Ridge Regression (RR) technique has been used for effort estimation yielding promising results. In this work we show that results may be further improved if an AI method is used to automatically select appropriate project cost drivers (inputs) for the technique. We propose a hybrid approach combining RR with a Genetic Algorithm, the latter evolving the subset of attributes for approximating effort more accurately. The proposed hybrid cost model has been applied on a widely known high-dimensional dataset of software project samples and the results obtained show that accuracy may be increased if redundant attributes are eliminated.",0,Human
"In the last two years, more than 200 papers have been written on how machine learning (ML) systems can fail because of adversarial attacks on the algorithms and data; this number balloons if we were to incorporate papers covering non-adversarial failure modes. The spate of papers has made it difficult for ML practitioners, let alone engineers, lawyers, and policymakers, to keep up with the attacks against and defenses of ML systems. However, as these systems become more pervasive, the need to understand how they fail, whether by the hand of an adversary or due to the inherent design of a system, will only become more pressing. In order to equip software developers, security incident responders, lawyers, and policy makers with a common vernacular to talk about this problem, we developed a framework to classify failures into ""Intentional failures"" where the failure is caused by an active adversary attempting to subvert the system to attain her goals; and ""Unintentional failures"" where the failure is because an ML system produces an inherently unsafe outcome. After developing the initial version of the taxonomy last year, we worked with security and ML teams across Microsoft, 23 external partners, standards organization, and governments to understand how stakeholders would use our framework. Throughout the paper, we attempt to highlight how machine learning failure modes are meaningfully different from traditional software failures from a technology and policy perspective.",0,Human

"The visual cue of optical flow plays a major role in the navigation of flying insects, and is increasingly studied for use by small flying robots as well. A major problem is that successful optical flow control seems to require distance estimates, while optical flow is known to provide only the ratio of velocity to distance. In this article, a novel, stability-based strategy is proposed to estimate distances with monocular optical flow and knowledge of the control inputs (efference copies). It is shown analytically that given a fixed control gain, the stability of a constant divergence control loop only depends on the distance to the approached surface. At close distances, the control loop first starts to exhibit self-induced oscillations, eventually leading to instability. The proposed stability-based strategy for estimating distances has two major attractive characteristics. First, self-induced oscillations are easy for the robot to detect and are hardly influenced by wind. Second, the distance can be estimated during a zero divergence maneuver, i.e., around hover. The stability-based strategy is implemented and tested both in simulation and with a Parrot AR drone 2.0. It is shown that it can be used to: (1) trigger a final approach response during a constant divergence landing with fixed gain, (2) estimate the distance in hover, and (3) estimate distances during an entire landing if the robot uses adaptive gain control to continuously stay on the 'edge of oscillation'.",0,Human

Taking the standard market equilibrium approach, upon receiving submitted bid vectors from the buyers, the market maker will decide on a price vector to clear the market in such a way that each buyer is allocated an item for which he desires the most (a.k.a., a market equilibrium solution). While such equilibrium outcomes are not unique, the market maker chooses one (maxeq) that optimizes its own objective --- revenue maximization. The buyers in turn change bids to their best interests in order to obtain higher utilities in the next round's market equilibrium solution.  This is an (n+1)-person game where buyers place strategic bids to gain the most from the market maker's equilibrium mechanism. The incentives of buyers in deciding their bids and the market maker's choice of using the maxeq mechanism create a wave of Nash dynamics involved in the market. We characterize Nash equilibria in the dynamics in terms of the relationship between maxeq and mineq (i.e., minimum revenue equilibrium), and develop convergence results for Nash dynamics from the maxeq policy to a mineq solution, resulting an outcome equivalent to the truthful VCG mechanism.  Our results imply revenue equivalence between maxeq and mineq, and address the question that why short-term revenue maximization is a poor long run strategy, in a deterministic and dynamic setting.",0,Human
"Learning disentangled representation of data without supervision is an important step towards improving the interpretability of generative models. Despite recent advances in disentangled representation learning, existing approaches often suffer from the trade-off between representation learning and generation performance i.e. improving generation quality sacrifices disentanglement performance). We propose an Information-Distillation Generative Adversarial Network (ID-GAN), a simple yet generic framework that easily incorporates the existing state-of-the-art models for both disentanglement learning and high-fidelity synthesis. Our method learns disentangled representation using VAE-based models, and distills the learned representation with an additional nuisance variable to the separate GAN-based generator for high-fidelity synthesis. To ensure that both generative models are aligned to render the same generative factors, we further constrain the GAN generator to maximize the mutual information between the learned latent code and the output. Despite the simplicity, we show that the proposed method is highly effective, achieving comparable image generation quality to the state-of-the-art methods using the disentangled representation. We also show that the proposed decomposition leads to an efficient and stable model design, and we demonstrate photo-realistic high-resolution image synthesis results (1024x1024 pixels) for the first time using the disentangled representations.",0,Human
"The proven efficacy of learning-based control schemes strongly motivates their application to robotic systems operating in the physical world. However, guaranteeing correct operation during the learning process is currently an unresolved issue, which is of vital importance in safety-critical systems. We propose a general safety framework based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability methods that can work in conjunction with an arbitrary learning algorithm. The method exploits approximate knowledge of the system dynamics to guarantee constraint satisfaction while minimally interfering with the learning process. We further introduce a Bayesian mechanism that refines the safety analysis as the system acquires new evidence, reducing initial conservativeness when appropriate while strengthening guarantees through real-time validation. The result is a least-restrictive, safety-preserving control law that intervenes only when (a) the computed safety guarantees require it, or (b) confidence in the computed guarantees decays in light of new observations. We prove theoretical safety guarantees combining probabilistic and worst-case analysis and demonstrate the proposed framework experimentally on a quadrotor vehicle. Even though safety analysis is based on a simple point-mass model, the quadrotor successfully arrives at a suitable controller by policy-gradient reinforcement learning without ever crashing, and safely retracts away from a strong external disturbance introduced during flight.",0,Human

"This study introduces a hybrid inference system aimed at enhancing the precision of curvature estimation within the level-set method by leveraging machine learning. The level-set method is extensively utilized across multiple domains including computer vision, medical imaging, and graphic design, primarily due to its effectiveness in modeling shapes and segmenting images. The accuracy of the level-set's progression hinges significantly on the reliability of curvature estimation, making this aspect critical. However, conventional techniques for curvature estimation are subject to drawbacks like susceptibility to noise and irregular data sampling. To address these issues, the researchers have developed a hybrid inference system that integrates both traditional curvature estimation methodologies and machine learning algorithms. This system employs a machine learning model that has been trained on extensive datasets comprising both synthetic and real-world images. Through this training process, the model learns to forecast curvature values at various points along the evolving interface based on localized image characteristics. The hybrid system then merges the predictions generated by the machine learning model with the outcomes from traditional curvature estimation methods, thereby producing more precise and resilient curvature estimates. The performance of the proposed hybrid inference system was assessed using diverse datasets, and its efficacy was compared against conventional curvature estimation techniques. The findings demonstrated superior performance of the hybrid system in terms of both accuracy and robustness. Additionally, the computational efficiency of the proposed system makes it suitable for integration into existing level-set algorithms without significant overhead. In summary, this research offers a promising advancement towards enhancing the accuracy and resilience of the level-set method through the application of machine learning-based strategies. Furthermore, the suggested system can potentially be adapted for other shape modeling and segmentation techniques that require curvature estimation.",1,AI
"Writing accurate numerical software is hard because of many sources of unavoidable uncertainties, including finite numerical precision of implementations. We present a programming model where the user writes a program in a real-valued implementation and specification language that explicitly includes different types of uncertainties. We then present a compilation algorithm that generates a conventional implementation that is guaranteed to meet the desired precision with respect to real numbers. Our verification step generates verification conditions that treat different uncertainties in a unified way and encode reasoning about floating-point roundoff errors into reasoning about real numbers. Such verification conditions can be used as a standardized format for verifying the precision and the correctness of numerical programs. Due to their often non-linear nature, precise reasoning about such verification conditions remains difficult. We show that current state-of-the art SMT solvers do not scale well to solving such verification conditions. We propose a new procedure that combines exact SMT solving over reals with approximate and sound affine and interval arithmetic. We show that this approach overcomes scalability limitations of SMT solvers while providing improved precision over affine and interval arithmetic. Using our initial implementation we show the usefullness and effectiveness of our approach on several examples, including those containing non-linear computation.",0,Human

"We introduce Bee$^+$, a 95-mg four-winged microrobot with improved controllability and open-loop-response characteristics with respect to those exhibited by state-of-the-art two-winged microrobots with the same size and similar weight (i.e., the 75-mg Harvard RoboBee). The key innovation that made possible the development of Bee$^+$ is the introduction of an extremely light (28-mg) pair of twinned unimorph actuators, which enabled the design of a new microrobotic mechanism that flaps four wings independently. A first main advantage of the proposed design, compared to those of two-winged flyers, is that by increasing the number of actuators from two to four, the number of direct control inputs increases from three to four when simple sinusoidal excitations are employed. A second advantage of Bee$^+$ is that its four-wing configuration and flapping mode naturally damp the rotational disturbances that commonly affect the yaw degree of freedom of two-winged microrobots. In addition, the proposed design greatly reduces the complexity of the associated fabrication process compared to those of other microrobots, as the unimorph actuators are fairly easy to build. Lastly, we hypothesize that given the relatively low wing-loading affecting their flapping mechanisms, the life expectancy of Bee$^+$s must be considerably higher than those of the two-winged counterparts. The functionality and basic capabilities of the robot are demonstrated through a set of simple control experiments.",0,Human
"In this paper we investigate the problem of allocating spectrum among radio nodes under SINR requirements. This problem is of special interest in dynamic spectrum access networks where topology and spectral resources differ with time and location. The problem is to determine the number of radio nodes that can transmit simultaneously while still achieving their SINR requirements and then decide which channels these nodes should transmit on. Previous work have shown how this can be done for a large spectrum pool where nodes allocate multiple channels from that pool which renders a linear programming approach feasible when the pool is large enough. In this paper we extend their work by considering arbitrary individual pool sizes and allow nodes to only transmit on one channel. Due to the accumulative nature of interference this problem is a non-convex integer problem which is NP-hard. However, we introduce a constraint transformation that transforms the problem to a binary quadratic constraint problem. Although this problem is still NP-hard, well known heuristic algorithms for solving this problem are known in the literature. We implement a heuristic algorithm based on Lagrange relaxation which bounds the solution value of the heuristic to the optimal value of the constraint transformed problem. Simulation results show that this approach provides solutions within an average gap of 10% of solutions obtained by a genetic algorithm for the original non-convex integer problem.",0,Human

"Humans and animals are believed to use a very minimal set of trajectories to perform a wide variety of tasks including walking. Our main objective in this paper is two fold 1) Obtain an effective tool to realize these basic motion patterns for quadrupedal walking, called the kinematic motion primitives (kMPs), via trajectories learned from deep reinforcement learning (D-RL) and 2) Realize a set of behaviors, namely trot, walk, gallop and bound from these kinematic motion primitives in our custom four legged robot, called the `Stoch'. D-RL is a data driven approach, which has been shown to be very effective for realizing all kinds of robust locomotion behaviors, both in simulation and in experiment. On the other hand, kMPs are known to capture the underlying structure of walking and yield a set of derived behaviors. We first generate walking gaits from D-RL, which uses policy gradient based approaches. We then analyze the resulting walking by using principal component analysis. We observe that the kMPs extracted from PCA followed a similar pattern irrespective of the type of gaits generated. Leveraging on this underlying structure, we then realize walking in Stoch by a straightforward reconstruction of joint trajectories from kMPs. This type of methodology improves the transferability of these gaits to real hardware, lowers the computational overhead on-board, and also avoids multiple training iterations by generating a set of derived behaviors from a single learned gait.",0,Human
"Depth coding in 3D-HEVC for the multiview video plus depth (MVD) architecture (i) deforms object shapes due to block-level edge-approximation; (ii) misses an opportunity for high compressibility at near-lossless quality by failing to exploit strong homogeneity (clustering tendency) in depth syntax, motion vector components, and residuals at frame-level; and (iii) restricts interactivity and limits responsiveness of independent use of depth information for ""non-viewing"" applications due to texture-depth coding dependency. This paper presents a standalone depth sequence coder, which operates in the lossless to near-lossless quality range while compressing depth data superior to lossy 3D-HEVC. It preserves edges implicitly by limiting quantisation to the spatial-domain and exploits clustering tendency efficiently at frame-level with a novel binary tree based decomposition (BTBD) technique. For mono-view coding of standard MVD test sequences, on average, (i) lossless BTBD achieved $\times 42.2$ compression-ratio and $-60.0\%$ coding gain against the pseudo-lossless 3D-HEVC, using the lowest quantisation parameter $QP = 1$, and (ii) near-lossless BTBD achieved $-79.4\%$ and $6.98$ dB Bj{\o}ntegaard delta bitrate (BD-BR) and distortion (BD-PSNR), respectively, against 3D-HEVC.

"Entity resolution is a widely studied problem with several proposals to match records across relations. Matching textual content is a widespread task in many applications, such as question answering and search. While recent methods achieve promising results for these two tasks, there is no clear solution for the more general problem of matching textual content and structured data. We introduce a framework that supports this new task in an unsupervised setting for any pair of corpora, being relational tables or text documents. Our method builds a fine-grained graph over the content of the corpora and derives word embeddings to represent the objects to match in a low dimensional space. The learned representation enables effective and efficient matching at different granularity, from relational tuples to text sentences and paragraphs. Our flexible framework can exploit pre-trained resources, but it does not depends on their existence and achieves better quality performance in matching content when the vocabulary is domain specific. We also introduce optimizations in the graph creation process with an ""expand and compress"" approach that first identifies new valid relationships across elements, to improve matching, and then prunes nodes and edges, to reduce the graph size. Experiments on real use cases and public datasets show that our framework produces embeddings that outperform word embeddings and fine-tuned language models both in results' quality and in execution times.",0,Human
"To tackle the challenge of creating a critical geometric graph (CGG) in dense wireless sensor networks (WSNs) via a decentralized method, this research delves into the topic. The CGG is crucial in WSNs, capturing the spatial connections among nodes and is extensively utilized in numerous applications. However, building a CGG in dense WSNs is tricky due to the sheer number of nodes and the restricted communication range. To solve this issue, we introduce a novel distributed algorithm that benefits from the characteristics of Delaunay triangulation and Gabriel graphs. This algorithm operates iteratively, divided into three key steps: choosing nodes, local graph construction, and global coordination.

In the initial stage, every node picks a group of potential neighboring nodes according to Delaunay triangulation. Following this, during the local construction phase, each node forms a localized subgraph utilizing its chosen neighbors and applying Gabriel graph principles. Lastly, in the synchronization phase, these local subgraphs are amalgamated to form the complete CGG. We validate our proposed algorithm via thorough simulations and contrast it against other methods. The simulation outcomes reveal that our technique effectively generates a precise and efficient CGG, even within densely packed WSN environments. Additionally, our algorithm shows superior performance concerning both construction time and energy utilization compared to existing solutions. Overall, the proposed distributed strategy offers a viable approach for generating the CGG in dense WSNs, applicable to diverse applications like positioning, routing, and coverage management.",1,AI

"We present a strategy grounded in the element removal idea of Bruns and Tortorelli [1] and aimed at reducing computational cost and circumventing potential numerical instabilities of density-based topology optimization. The design variables and the relative densities are both represented on a fixed, uniform finite element grid, and linked through filtering and Heaviside projection. The regions in the analysis domain where the relative density is below a specified threshold are removed from the forward analysis and replaced by fictitious nodal boundary conditions. This brings a progressive cut of the computational cost as the optimization proceeds and helps to mitigate numerical instabilities associated with low-density regions. Removed regions can be readily reintroduced since all the design variables remain active and are modeled in the formal sensitivity analysis. A key feature of the proposed approach is that the Heaviside functions promote material reintroduction along the structural boundaries by amplifying the magnitude of the sensitivities inside the filter reach. Several 2D and 3D structural topology optimization examples are presented, including linear and nonlinear compliance minimization, the design of a force inverter, and frequency and buckling load maximization. The approach is shown to be effective at producing optimized designs equivalent or nearly equivalent to those obtained without the element removal, while providing remarkable computational savings.",0,Human
"Machine learning techniques have enabled robots to learn narrow, yet complex tasks and also perform broad, yet simple skills with a wide variety of objects. However, learning a model that can both perform complex tasks and generalize to previously unseen objects and goals remains a significant challenge. We study this challenge in the context of ""improvisational"" tool use: a robot is presented with novel objects and a user-specified goal (e.g., sweep some clutter into the dustpan), and must figure out, using only raw image observations, how to accomplish the goal using the available objects as tools. We approach this problem by training a model with both a visual and physical understanding of multi-object interactions, and develop a sampling-based optimizer that can leverage these interactions to accomplish tasks. We do so by combining diverse demonstration data with self-supervised interaction data, aiming to leverage the interaction data to build generalizable models and the demonstration data to guide the model-based RL planner to solve complex tasks. Our experiments show that our approach can solve a variety of complex tool use tasks from raw pixel inputs, outperforming both imitation learning and self-supervised learning individually. Furthermore, we show that the robot can perceive and use novel objects as tools, including objects that are not conventional tools, while also choosing dynamically to use or not use tools depending on whether or not they are required.",0,Human
"This paper studies the problem of predicting missing relationships between entities in knowledge graphs through learning their representations. Currently, the majority of existing link prediction models employ simple but intuitive scoring functions and relatively small embedding size so that they could be applied to large-scale knowledge graphs. However, these properties also restrict the ability to learn more expressive and robust features. Therefore, diverging from most of the prior works which focus on designing new objective functions, we propose, DeCom, a simple but effective mechanism to boost the performance of existing link predictors such as DistMult, ComplEx, etc, through extracting more expressive features while preventing overfitting by adding just a few extra parameters. Specifically, embeddings of entities and relationships are first decompressed to a more expressive and robust space by decompressing functions, then knowledge graph embedding models are trained in this new feature space. Experimental results on several benchmark knowledge graphs and advanced link prediction systems demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of our method. Especially, RESCAL + DeCom achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FB15k-237 benchmark across all evaluation metrics. In addition, we also show that compared with DeCom, explicitly increasing the embedding size significantly increase the number of parameters but could not achieve promising performance improvement.",0,Human
"Trans-dimensional random field language models (TRF LMs) have recently been introduced, where sentences are modeled as a collection of random fields. The TRF approach has been shown to have the advantages of being computationally more efficient in inference than LSTM LMs with close performance and being able to flexibly integrating rich features. In this paper we propose neural TRFs, beyond of the previous discrete TRFs that only use linear potentials with discrete features. The idea is to use nonlinear potentials with continuous features, implemented by neural networks (NNs), in the TRF framework. Neural TRFs combine the advantages of both NNs and TRFs. The benefits of word embedding, nonlinear feature learning and larger context modeling are inherited from the use of NNs. At the same time, the strength of efficient inference by avoiding expensive softmax is preserved. A number of technical contributions, including employing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to define the potentials and incorporating the joint stochastic approximation (JSA) strategy in the training algorithm, are developed in this work, which enable us to successfully train neural TRF LMs. Various LMs are evaluated in terms of speech recognition WERs by rescoring the 1000-best lists of WSJ'92 test data. The results show that neural TRF LMs not only improve over discrete TRF LMs, but also perform slightly better than LSTM LMs with only one fifth of parameters and 16x faster inference efficiency.",0,Human
"The field of analyzing performance is very important and sensitive in particular when it is related to the performance of lecturers in academic institutions. Locating the weak points of lecturers through a system that provides an early warning to notify or reward the lecturers with warned or punished notices will help them to improve their weaknesses, leads to a better quality in the institutions.

"Unless special conditions apply, the attempt to solve ill-conditioned systems of linear equations with standard numerical methods leads to uncontrollably high numerical error. Often, such systems arise from the discretization of operator equations with a large number of discrete variables. In this paper we show that the accuracy can be improved significantly if the equation is transformed before discretization, a process we call full operator preconditioning (FOP). It bears many similarities with traditional preconditioning for iterative methods but, crucially, transformations are applied at the operator level. We show that while condition-number improvements from traditional preconditioning generally do not improve the accuracy of the solution, FOP can. A number of topics in numerical analysis can be interpreted as implicitly employing FOP; we highlight (i) Chebyshev interpolation in polynomial approximation, and (ii) Olver-Townsend's spectral method, both of which produce solutions of dramatically improved accuracy over a naive problem formulation. In addition, we propose a FOP preconditioner based on integration for the solution of fourth-order differential equations with the finite-element method, showing the resulting linear system is well-conditioned regardless of the discretization size, and demonstrate its error-reduction capabilities on several examples. This work shows that FOP can improve accuracy beyond the standard limit for both direct and iterative methods.",0,Human
"MIMO processing plays a central part towards the recent increase in spectral and energy efficiencies of wireless networks. MIMO has grown beyond the original point-to-point channel and nowadays refers to a diverse range of centralized and distributed deployments. The fundamental bottleneck towards enormous spectral and energy efficiency benefits in multiuser MIMO networks lies in a huge demand for accurate channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). This has become increasingly difficult to satisfy due to the increasing number of antennas and access points in next generation wireless networks relying on dense heterogeneous networks and transmitters equipped with a large number of antennas. CSIT inaccuracy results in a multi-user interference problem that is the primary bottleneck of MIMO wireless networks. Looking backward, the problem has been to strive to apply techniques designed for perfect CSIT to scenarios with imperfect CSIT. In this paper, we depart from this conventional approach and introduce the readers to a promising strategy based on rate-splitting. Rate-splitting relies on the transmission of common and private messages and is shown to provide significant benefits in terms of spectral and energy efficiencies, reliability and CSI feedback overhead reduction over conventional strategies used in LTE-A and exclusively relying on private message transmissions. Open problems, impact on standard specifications and operational challenges are also discussed.",0,Human
"Quantum computation promises significant computational advantages over classical computation for some problems. However, quantum hardware suffers from much higher error rates than in classical hardware. As a result, extensive quantum error correction is required to execute a useful quantum algorithm. The decoder is a key component of the error correction scheme whose role is to identify errors faster than they accumulate in the quantum computer and that must be implemented with minimum hardware resources in order to scale to the regime of practical applications. In this work, we consider surface code error correction, which is the most popular family of error correcting codes for quantum computing, and we design a decoder micro-architecture for the Union-Find decoding algorithm. We propose a three-stage fully pipelined hardware implementation of the decoder that significantly speeds up the decoder. Then, we optimize the amount of decoding hardware required to perform error correction simultaneously over all the logical qubits of the quantum computer. By sharing resources between logical qubits, we obtain a 67% reduction of the number of hardware units and the memory capacity is reduced by 70%. Moreover, we reduce the bandwidth required for the decoding process by a factor at least 30x using low-overhead compression algorithms. Finally, we provide numerical evidence that our optimized micro-architecture can be executed fast enough to correct errors in a quantum computer.",0,Human
"When 5G began its commercialisation journey around 2020, the discussion on the vision of 6G also surfaced. Researchers expect 6G to have higher bandwidth, coverage, reliability, energy efficiency, lower latency, and, more importantly, an integrated ""human-centric"" network system powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Such a 6G network will lead to an excessive number of automated decisions made every second. These decisions can range widely, from network resource allocation to collision avoidance for self-driving cars. However, the risk of losing control over decision-making may increase due to high-speed data-intensive AI decision-making beyond designers and users' comprehension. The promising explainable AI (XAI) methods can mitigate such risks by enhancing the transparency of the black box AI decision-making process. This survey paper highlights the need for XAI towards the upcoming 6G age in every aspect, including 6G technologies (e.g., intelligent radio, zero-touch network management) and 6G use cases (e.g., industry 5.0). Moreover, we summarised the lessons learned from the recent attempts and outlined important research challenges in applying XAI for building 6G systems. This research aligns with goals 9, 11, 16, and 17 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDG), promoting innovation and building infrastructure, sustainable and inclusive human settlement, advancing justice and strong institutions, and fostering partnership at the global level.",0,Human
"Smart cities solutions are often monolithically implemented, from sensors data handling through to the provided services. The same challenges are regularly faced by different developers, for every new solution in a new city. Expertise and know-how can be re-used and the effort shared. In this article we present the methodologies to minimize the efforts of implementing new smart city solutions and maximizing the sharing of components. The final target is to have a live technical community of smart city application developers. The results of this activity comes from the implementation of 35 city services in 27 cities between Europe and South Korea. To share efforts, we encourage developers to devise applications using a modular approach. Single-function components that are re-usable by other city services are packaged and published as standalone components, named Atomic Services. We identify 15 atomic services addressing smart city challenges in data analytics, data evaluation, data integration, data validation, and visualization. 38 instances of the atomic services are already operational in several smart city services. We detail in this article, as atomic service examples, some data predictor components. Furthermore, we describe real-world atomic services usage in the scenarios of Santander and three Danish cities. The resulting atomic services also generate a side market for smart city solutions, allowing expertise and know-how to be re-used by different stakeholders.",0,Human
"We present Stable View Synthesis (SVS). Given a set of source images depicting a scene from freely distributed viewpoints, SVS synthesizes new views of the scene. The method operates on a geometric scaffold computed via structure-from-motion and multi-view stereo. Each point on this 3D scaffold is associated with view rays and corresponding feature vectors that encode the appearance of this point in the input images. The core of SVS is view-dependent on-surface feature aggregation, in which directional feature vectors at each 3D point are processed to produce a new feature vector for a ray that maps this point into the new target view. The target view is then rendered by a convolutional network from a tensor of features synthesized in this way for all pixels. The method is composed of differentiable modules and is trained end-to-end. It supports spatially-varying view-dependent importance weighting and feature transformation of source images at each point; spatial and temporal stability due to the smooth dependence of on-surface feature aggregation on the target view; and synthesis of view-dependent effects such as specular reflection. Experimental results demonstrate that SVS outperforms state-of-the-art view synthesis methods both quantitatively and qualitatively on three diverse real-world datasets, achieving unprecedented levels of realism in free-viewpoint video of challenging large-scale scenes.

"Processing of symbolic sequences represented by mapping of symbolic data into numerical signals is commonly used in various applications. It is a particularly popular approach in genomic and proteomic sequence analysis. Numerous mappings of symbolic sequences have been proposed for various applications. It is unclear however whether the processing of symbolic data provides an artifact of the numerical mapping or is an inherent property of the symbolic data. This issue has been long ignored in the engineering and scientific literature. It is possible that many of the results obtained in symbolic signal processing could be a byproduct of the mapping and might not shed any light on the underlying properties embedded in the data. Moreover, in many applications, conflicting conclusions may arise due to the choice of the mapping used for numerical representation of symbolic data. In this paper, we present a novel framework for the analysis of the equivalence of the mappings used for numerical representation of symbolic data. We present strong and weak equivalence properties and rely on signal correlation to characterize equivalent mappings. We derive theoretical results which establish conditions for consistency among numerical mappings of symbolic data. Furthermore, we introduce an abstract mapping model for symbolic sequences and extend the notion of equivalence to an algebraic framework. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical results by application to DNA sequence analysis.",0,Human
"Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) are developing at a very fast pace to enable smart transportation in urban cities, by designing some mechanisms for decreasing travel time for commuters by reducing congestion. Inefficient Traffic signals and routing mechanisms are the major factors that contribute to the increase of road congestion. For smoother traffic movement and reducing congestion on the roads, the waiting time at intersections must be reduced and an optimal path should be chosen simultaneously. In this paper, A GPU assisted Preemptive MACO (GMACO-P) algorithm has been proposed to minimize the total travel time of the commuters. GMACO-P is an improvement of MACO-P algorithm that uses the harnessing the power of the GPU to provide faster computations for further minimizing the travel time. The MACO-P algorithm is based on an existing MACO algorithm that avoid the path with the congestion. The MACO-P algorithm reduces the average queue length at intersections by incorporating preemption that ensures less waiting time. In this paper, GMACO-P algorithm is proposed harnessing the power of GPU to improve MACO-P to further reduce the travel time. The GMACO-P algorithm is executed with CUDA toolkit 7.5 using C language and the obtained results were compared with existing Dijkstra, ACO, MACO, MACO-P, parallel implementation of the Dijkstra, ACO and MACO algorithms.

"The human visual perception system has very strong robustness and contextual awareness in a variety of image processing tasks. This robustness and the perception ability of contextual awareness is closely related to the characteristics of multi-task auxiliary learning and subjective attention of the human visual perception system. In order to improve the robustness and contextual awareness of image fusion tasks, we proposed a multi-task auxiliary learning image fusion theory guided by subjective attention. The image fusion theory effectively unifies the subjective task intention and prior knowledge of human brain. In order to achieve our proposed image fusion theory, we first analyze the mechanism of multi-task auxiliary learning, build a multi-task auxiliary learning network. Secondly, based on the human visual attention perception mechanism, we introduce the human visual attention network guided by subjective tasks on the basis of the multi-task auxiliary learning network. The subjective intention is introduced by the subjective attention task model, so that the network can fuse images according to the subjective intention. Finally, in order to verify the superiority of our image fusion theory, we carried out experiments on the combined vision system image data set, and the infrared and visible image data set for experimental verification. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our fusion theory over state-of-arts in contextual awareness and robustness.",0,Human

"A color image contains luminance and chrominance components representing the intensity and color information respectively. The objective of the work presented in this paper is to show the significance of incorporating the chrominance information for the task of scene classification. An improved color-to-grayscale image conversion algorithm by effectively incorporating the chrominance information is proposed using color-to-gay structure similarity index (C2G-SSIM) and singular value decomposition (SVD) to improve the perceptual quality of the converted grayscale images. The experimental result analysis based on the image quality assessment for image decolorization called C2G-SSIM and success rate (Cadik and COLOR250 datasets) shows that the proposed image decolorization technique performs better than 8 existing benchmark algorithms for image decolorization. In the second part of the paper, the effectiveness of incorporating the chrominance component in scene classification task is demonstrated using the deep belief network (DBN) based image classification system developed using dense scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) as features. The levels of chrominance information incorporated by the proposed image decolorization technique is confirmed by the improvement in the overall scene classification accuracy .

Furthermore, the study incorporates a motion-state classification mechanism to accurately differentiate between stationary and mobile objects, which aids in the efficiency and reliability of the masking process. The efficacy of the proposed approach is validated via rigorous testing on actual outdoor construction environments. Experimental outcomes indicate that the proposed SLAM technique surpasses contemporary methods in both accuracy and resistance to interference from large, active elements.",1,AI

"This research examines how to enhance the fault tolerance of digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs). These chips have the potential to transform bioanalysis by streamlining complex laboratory procedures into smaller, automated processes. However, due to their intricate nature and extensive integration, DMFBs are prone to numerous faults and errors that could undermine their efficiency and dependability. To address this issue, our proposed design flow includes four key stages: fault modeling, fault analysis, fault-tolerant synthesis, and fault-tolerant testing. In the fault modeling phase, we identify potential faults and their root causes within the DMFB design. Fault analysis evaluates how these faults affect the chip's performance and functionality. The fault-tolerant synthesis stage aims to create a design that can withstand and correct identified faults. Lastly, the fault-tolerant testing phase confirms the new design's performance and reliability. We validate this process using a case study involving a DMFB designed for protein crystallization, which requires a series of intricate biochemical reactions. Fault injection tests confirm the effectiveness of the fault-tolerant design, demonstrating that our method can significantly improve DMFB fault tolerance.

This design flow serves as a blueprint for creating dependable and robust DMFBs suitable for various bioanalysis applications.",1,AI
"An accountable algorithmic transparency report (ATR) should ideally investigate the (a) transparency of the underlying algorithm, and (b) fairness of the algorithmic decisions, and at the same time preserve data subjects' privacy. However, a provably formal study of the impact to data subjects' privacy caused by the utility of releasing an ATR (that investigates transparency and fairness), is yet to be addressed in the literature. The far-fetched benefit of such a study lies in the methodical characterization of privacy-utility trade-offs for release of ATRs in public, and their consequential application-specific impact on the dimensions of society, politics, and economics. In this paper, we first investigate and demonstrate potential privacy hazards brought on by the deployment of transparency and fairness measures in released ATRs. To preserve data subjects' privacy, we then propose a linear-time optimal-privacy scheme, built upon standard linear fractional programming (LFP) theory, for announcing ATRs, subject to constraints controlling the tolerance of privacy perturbation on the utility of transparency schemes. Subsequently, we quantify the privacy-utility trade-offs induced by our scheme, and analyze the impact of privacy perturbation on fairness measures in ATRs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analytical work that simultaneously addresses trade-offs between the triad of privacy, utility, and fairness, applicable to algorithmic transparency reports.",0,Human

"Transmission over multiple frequency bands combined into one logical channel speeds up data transfer for wireless networks. On the other hand, the allocation of multiple channels to a single user decreases the probability of finding a free logical channel for new connections, which may result in a network-wide throughput loss. While this relationship has been studied experimentally, especially in the WLAN configuration, little is known on how to analytically model such phenomena. With the advent of Opportunistic Spectrum Access (OSA) networks, it is even more important to understand the circumstances in which it is beneficial to bond channels occupied by primary users with dynamic duty cycle patterns. In this paper we propose an analytical framework which allows the investigation of the average channel throughput at the medium access control layer for OSA networks with channel bonding enabled. We show that channel bonding is generally beneficial, though the extent of the benefits depend on the features of the OSA network, including OSA network size and the total number of channels available for bonding. In addition, we show that performance benefits can be realized by adaptively changing the number of bonded channels depending on network conditions. Finally, we evaluate channel bonding considering physical layer constraints, i.e. throughput reduction compared to the theoretical throughput of a single virtual channel due to a transmission power limit for any bonding size.",0,Human
"This research explores the interactions within a medium during diffusion-based molecular communication in a two-way relay setup. Diffusion-based molecular communication holds promise for communication in tiny devices and systems due to limitations posed by the absence of electromagnetic waves. In this study, a two-way relay model is examined, focusing on how two nanomachines can exchange information via molecule diffusion in a medium. The medium is conceptualized as a divided system, where each division symbolizes a distinct setting with varying reaction speeds. A mathematical model is developed to describe the reaction rates of the medium and the molecular signals, and equations are derived to calculate the bit error rate (BER) and the communication system's capacity. Using this framework, the impact of medium reactions on system performance is analyzed. Simulation outcomes show that medium reactions substantially influence both the BER and the system's capacity, and the proposed framework can be employed to enhance system performance by adjusting the medium's reaction rates. These insights are valuable for designing and optimizing diffusion-based molecular communication systems, particularly in environments where chemical reactions play a crucial role.",1,AI

"In the last years, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) have been applied to different software engineering problems where many conflicting objectives have to be optimized simultaneously. In theory, evolutionary algorithms feature a nice property for runtime optimization as they can provide a solution in any execution time. In practice, based on a Darwinian inspired natural selection, these evolutionary algorithms produce many deadborn solutions whose computation results in a computational resources wastage: natural selection is naturally slow. In this paper, we reconsider this founding analogy to accelerate convergence of MOEA, by looking at modern biology studies: artificial selection has been used to achieve an anticipated specific purpose instead of only relying on crossover and natural selection (i.e., Muller et al [18] research on artificial mutation of fruits with X-Ray). Putting aside the analogy with natural selection , the present paper proposes an hyper-heuristic for MOEA algorithms named Sputnik 1 that uses artificial selective mutation to improve the convergence speed of MOEA. Sputnik leverages the past history of mutation efficiency to select the most relevant mutations to perform. We evaluate Sputnik on a cloud-reasoning engine, which drives on-demand provisioning while considering conflicting performance and cost objectives. We have conducted experiments to highlight the significant performance improvement of Sputnik in terms of resolution time.",0,Human
"Machine learning models have been successfully used in many scientific and engineering fields. However, it remains difficult for a model to simultaneously utilize domain knowledge and experimental observation data. The application of knowledge-based symbolic AI represented by an expert system is limited by the expressive ability of the model, and data-driven connectionism AI represented by neural networks is prone to produce predictions that violate physical mechanisms. In order to fully integrate domain knowledge with observations, and make full use of the prior information and the strong fitting ability of neural networks, this study proposes theory-guided hard constraint projection (HCP). This model converts physical constraints, such as governing equations, into a form that is easy to handle through discretization, and then implements hard constraint optimization through projection. Based on rigorous mathematical proofs, theory-guided HCP can ensure that model predictions strictly conform to physical mechanisms in the constraint patch. The performance of the theory-guided HCP is verified by experiments based on the heterogeneous subsurface flow problem. Due to the application of hard constraints, compared with fully connected neural networks and soft constraint models, such as theory-guided neural networks and physics-informed neural networks, theory-guided HCP requires fewer data, and achieves higher prediction accuracy and stronger robustness to noisy observations.",0,Human

"3D object detection based on point clouds has become more and more popular. Some methods propose localizing 3D objects directly from raw point clouds to avoid information loss. However, these methods come with complex structures and significant computational overhead, limiting its broader application in real-time scenarios. Some methods choose to transform the point cloud data into compact tensors first and leverage off-the-shelf 2D detectors to propose 3D objects, which is much faster and achieves state-of-the-art results. However, because of the inconsistency between 2D and 3D data, we argue that the performance of compact tensor-based 3D detectors is restricted if we use 2D detectors without corresponding modification. Specifically, the distribution of point clouds is uneven, with most points gather on the boundary of objects, while detectors for 2D data always extract features evenly. Motivated by this observation, we propose DENse Feature Indicator (DENFI), a universal module that helps 3D detectors focus on the densest region of the point clouds in a boundary-aware manner. Moreover, DENFI is lightweight and guarantees real-time speed when applied to 3D object detectors. Experiments on KITTI dataset show that DENFI improves the performance of the baseline single-stage detector remarkably, which achieves new state-of-the-art performance among previous 3D detectors, including both two-stage and multi-sensor fusion methods, in terms of mAP with a 34FPS detection speed.",0,Human

"Semantic segmentation of aerial videos has been extensively used for decision making in monitoring environmental changes, urban planning, and disaster management. The reliability of these decision support systems is dependent on the accuracy of the video semantic segmentation algorithms. The existing CNN based video semantic segmentation methods have enhanced the image semantic segmentation methods by incorporating an additional module such as LSTM or optical flow for computing temporal dynamics of the video which is a computational overhead. The proposed research work modifies the CNN architecture by incorporating temporal information to improve the efficiency of video semantic segmentation.  In this work, an enhanced encoder-decoder based CNN architecture (UVid-Net) is proposed for UAV video semantic segmentation. The encoder of the proposed architecture embeds temporal information for temporally consistent labelling. The decoder is enhanced by introducing the feature-refiner module, which aids in accurate localization of the class labels.

"As there's a growing need for rapid internet access and robust mobile network coverage, drones equipped with base stations have become a viable option to bolster network availability in hard-to-reach and disaster-hit regions. Nevertheless, managing handovers‚Äîtransferring a user‚Äôs connection from one base station to another‚Äîis an ongoing challenge for these flying networks because of their fast movement and narrow range of influence. This paper introduces a group handover method for drone-mounted base stations within mobile networks. Our proposed approach seeks to cut down handover delays and guarantee constant connectivity for numerous users even when the drone is on the move. It employs an anticipatory handover technique, whereby the base station initiates the handover process prior to losing contact with the user. Additionally, our proposal takes into account the position and speed of the drone-mounted base station, along with the strength of the communication link between the user and the base station. To assess the effectiveness of our suggested solution, we conducted simulations in a real-world urban setting. These tests revealed that our strategy could decrease handover delays by up to 50% compared to conventional reactive handover methods. Furthermore, our proposal has been shown to enhance network throughput and decrease the incidence of failed handovers. In summary, our findings highlight the practicality of the proposed group handover method for drone-mounted base stations in mobile networks. This innovative approach not only improves service quality but also ensures smooth connections for users in underserved areas. Future studies may investigate how this strategy can be integrated with other handover management techniques and evaluated under various deployment conditions.",1,AI
"The development of positioning technologies has resulted in an increasing amount of mobility data being available. While bringing a lot of convenience to people's life, such availability also raises serious concerns about privacy. In this paper, we concentrate on one of the most sensitive information that can be inferred from mobility data, namely social relationships. We propose a novel social relation inference attack that relies on an advanced feature learning technique to automatically summarize users' mobility features. Compared to existing approaches, our attack is able to predict any two individuals' social relation, and it does not require the adversary to have any prior knowledge on existing social relations. These advantages significantly increase the applicability of our attack and the scope of the privacy assessment. Extensive experiments conducted on a large dataset demonstrate that our inference attack is effective, and achieves between 13% to 20% improvement over the best state-of-the-art scheme. We propose three defense mechanisms -- hiding, replacement and generalization -- and evaluate their effectiveness for mitigating the social link privacy risks stemming from mobility data sharing. Our experimental results show that both hiding and replacement mechanisms outperform generalization. Moreover, hiding and replacement achieve a comparable trade-off between utility and privacy, the former preserving better utility and the latter providing better privacy.",0,Human
"Communication or influence networks are probably the most controllable of all factors that are known to impact on the problem-solving capability of task-forces. In the case connections are costly, it is necessary to implement a policy to allocate them to the individuals. Here we use an agent-based model to study how distinct allocation policies affect the performance of a group of agents whose task is to find the global maxima of NK fitness landscapes. Agents cooperate by broadcasting messages informing on their fitness and use this information to imitate the fittest agent in their influence neighborhoods. The larger the influence neighborhood of an agent, the more links, and hence information, the agent receives. We find that the elitist policy in which agents with above-average fitness have their influence neighborhoods amplified, whereas agents with below-average fitness have theirs deflated, is optimal for smooth landscapes, provided the group size is not too small. For rugged landscapes, however, the elitist policy can perform very poorly for certain group sizes. In addition, we find that the egalitarian policy, in which the size of the influence neighborhood is the same for all agents, is optimal for both smooth and rugged landscapes in the case of small groups. The welfarist policy, in which the actions of the elitist policy are reversed, is always suboptimal, i.e., depending on the group size it is outperformed by either the elitist or the egalitarian policies.",0,Human
"Accountability is widely understood as a goal for well governed computer systems, and is a sought-after value in many governance contexts. But how can it be achieved? Recent work on standards for governable artificial intelligence systems offers a related principle: traceability. Traceability requires establishing not only how a system worked but how it was created and for what purpose, in a way that explains why a system has particular dynamics or behaviors. It connects records of how the system was constructed and what the system did mechanically to the broader goals of governance, in a way that highlights human understanding of that mechanical operation and the decision processes underlying it. We examine the various ways in which the principle of traceability has been articulated in AI principles and other policy documents from around the world, distill from these a set of requirements on software systems driven by the principle, and systematize the technologies available to meet those requirements. From our map of requirements to supporting tools, techniques, and procedures, we identify gaps and needs separating what traceability requires from the toolbox available for practitioners. This map reframes existing discussions around accountability and transparency, using the principle of traceability to show how, when, and why transparency can be deployed to serve accountability goals and thereby improve the normative fidelity of systems and their development processes.",0,Human

This modification enhances the accuracy and reliability of the LK algorithm by better handling differences in image data like lighting variations and object occlusions. To assess the efficacy of our enhanced CLK algorithm, we tested it on multiple standardized benchmark datasets alongside other advanced optical flow techniques. The results indicate that the CLK algorithm outperforms the original LK algorithm and similar alternatives, especially when dealing with complex situations involving significant movement and partial coverages. Additionally, we showcase how the CLK algorithm can be practically applied in practical scenarios such as visual odometry, where precise tracking of a camera's movement is crucial. Our findings reveal that the CLK algorithm provides not only better performance but also more efficient computation compared to other optical flow methods. In summary, our research underscores the CLK algorithm‚Äôs superiority over the LK algorithm and suggests its potential for enhancing the field of computer vision across diverse real-world applications.",1,AI
"As real-world images come in varying sizes, the machine learning model is part of a larger system that includes an upstream image scaling algorithm. In this system, the model and the scaling algorithm have become attractive targets for numerous attacks, such as adversarial examples and the recent image-scaling attack. In response to these attacks, researchers have developed defense approaches that are tailored to attacks at each processing stage. As these defenses are developed in isolation, their underlying assumptions may not hold when viewing them from the perspective of an end-to-end machine learning system. Thus, it is necessary to study these attacks and defenses in the context of machine learning systems. In this paper, we investigate the interplay between vulnerabilities of the image scaling procedure and machine learning models in the challenging hard-label black-box setting. We propose a series of novel techniques to make a black-box attack exploit vulnerabilities in scaling algorithms, scaling defenses, and the final machine learning model in an end-to-end manner. Based on this scaling-aware attack, we reveal that most existing scaling defenses are ineffective under threat from downstream models. Moreover, we empirically observe that standard black-box attacks can significantly improve their performance by exploiting the vulnerable scaling procedure. We further demonstrate this problem on a commercial Image Analysis API with transfer-based black-box attacks.",0,Human

"Over the past few years, there's been increasing interest in analyzing the computational complexity of different types of combinatorial voter control issues in elections. Combinatorial voter control involves altering the votes of a group of voters to influence the election outcome strategically. This study examines the computational complexities of several variations of this issue. Initially, we look at the standard voter control scenario, where the objective is to minimize the number of votes needed to change to achieve a specified winner. We demonstrate that solving this problem is NP-hard, indicating that large-scale instances of this problem are difficult to solve optimally. Following this, we investigate the complexities of related issues that incorporate limitations like financial constraints or restrictions on how many votes a single voter can have their say. We prove that even these modified versions are NP-hard and present methods for finding near-optimal solutions. Lastly, we analyze the computational challenges posed by voter control in various election formats, including single-winner elections, multi-winner elections, and those using proportional representation. We find that the difficulty level of the problem differs based on the type of election system used and develop algorithms to address these issues under each format. This research offers a thorough exploration of the computational complexity associated with combinatorial voter control problems in elections and offers guidance on designing algorithms to tackle these problems.",1,AI

"Purpose: Development of a fast and fully automated deep learning pipeline (FatSegNet) to accurately identify, segment, and quantify abdominal adipose tissue on Dixon MRI from the Rhineland Study - a large prospective population-based study. Method: FatSegNet is composed of three stages: (i) consistent localization of the abdominal region using two 2D-Competitive Dense Fully Convolutional Networks (CDFNet), (ii) segmentation of adipose tissue on three views by independent CDFNets, and (iii) view aggregation. FatSegNet is trained with 33 manually annotated subjects, and validated by: 1) comparison of segmentation accuracy against a testingset covering a wide range of body mass index (BMI), 2) test-retest reliability, and 3) robustness in a large cohort study.

"The problem of estimating sparse eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix attracts a lot of attention in many applications, especially those with high dimensional data set. While classical eigenvectors can be obtained as the solution of a maximization problem, existing approaches formulate this problem by adding a penalty term into the objective function that encourages a sparse solution. However, the resulting methods achieve sparsity at the expense of sacrificing the orthogonality property. In this paper, we develop a new method to estimate dominant sparse eigenvectors without trading off their orthogonality. The problem is highly non-convex and hard to handle. We apply the MM framework where we iteratively maximize a tight lower bound (surrogate function) of the objective function over the Stiefel manifold. The inner maximization problem turns out to be a rectangular Procrustes problem, which has a closed form solution. In addition, we propose a method to improve the covariance estimation problem when its underlying eigenvectors are known to be sparse. We use the eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix to formulate an optimization problem where we impose sparsity on the corresponding eigenvectors. Numerical experiments show that the proposed eigenvector extraction algorithm matches or outperforms existing algorithms in terms of support recovery and explained variance, while the covariance estimation algorithms improve significantly the sample covariance estimator.",0,Human
"This study explores how to lessen interference in Cloud Radio Access Networks (C-RANs) through the use of the rate-splitting technique coupled with common message decoding. While the rate-splitting method has shown promise in reducing interference and enhancing network efficiency, its implementation in C-RANs has been hindered by the challenges of coordinating transmissions between the Baseband Unit (BBU) and Remote Radio Heads (RRHs). In our research, we suggest integrating the rate-splitting technique and common message decoding at the BBU to address interference issues. We also introduce an innovative algorithm aimed at optimizing the rate-splitting parameters and common message decoding coefficients to balance power usage with service quality, ensuring satisfactory QoS for all users. Our simulations indicate that our proposed solution yields substantial improvements over conventional methods, particularly in high-density and heavily interfered environments. These results highlight the potential of rate-splitting and common message decoding as effective strategies for managing interference in C-RANs and offer guidance for developing advanced wireless systems.",1,AI
"Current evaluation functions for heuristic planning are expensive to compute. In numerous planning problems these functions provide good guidance to the solution, so they are worth the expense. However, when evaluation functions are misguiding or when planning problems are large enough, lots of node evaluations must be computed, which severely limits the scalability of heuristic planners. In this paper, we present a novel solution for reducing node evaluations in heuristic planning based on machine learning. Particularly, we define the task of learning search control for heuristic planning as a relational classification task, and we use an off-the-shelf relational classification tool to address this learning task. Our relational classification task captures the preferred action to select in the different planning contexts of a specific planning domain. These planning contexts are defined by the set of helpful actions of the current state, the goals remaining to be achieved, and the static predicates of the planning task. This paper shows two methods for guiding the search of a heuristic planner with the learned classifiers. The first one consists of using the resulting classifier as an action policy. The second one consists of applying the classifier to generate lookahead states within a Best First Search algorithm. Experiments over a variety of domains reveal that our heuristic planner using the learned classifiers solves larger problems than state-of-the-art planners.",0,Human

"E-commerce platforms usually display a mixed list of ads and organic items in feed. One key problem is to allocate the limited slots in the feed to maximize the overall revenue as well as improve user experience, which requires a good model for user preference. Instead of modeling the influence of individual items on user behaviors, the arrangement signal models the influence of the arrangement of items and may lead to a better allocation strategy. However, most of previous strategies fail to model such a signal and therefore result in suboptimal performance. In addition, the percentage of ads exposed (PAE) is an important indicator in ads allocation. Excessive PAE hurts user experience while too low PAE reduces platform revenue. Therefore, how to constrain the PAE within a certain range while keeping personalized recommendation under the PAE constraint is a challenge.  In this paper, we propose Cross Deep Q Network (Cross DQN) to extract the crucial arrangement signal by crossing the embeddings of different items and modeling the crossed sequence by multi-channel attention. Besides, we propose an auxiliary loss for batch-level constraint on PAE to tackle the above-mentioned challenge. Our model results in higher revenue and better user experience than state-of-the-art baselines in offline experiments. Moreover, our model demonstrates a significant improvement in the online A/B test and has been fully deployed on Meituan feed to serve more than 300 millions of customers.",0,Human
"This study examines the connectivity characteristics of random annulus graphs and the geometric block model, both of which are frequently utilized in network science to represent real-world networks with inherent geometric features. Specifically, our research zeroes in on the critical point at which these networks transition from being disconnected to becoming interconnected. Initially, we delve into the random annulus graph, a type of graph formed by randomly linking points within an annulus based on their Euclidean distance. We prove that the critical point for connectivity in this graph depends on a straightforward function of the annulus's parameters. Subsequently, we look at the geometric block model, where a d-dimensional space is divided into regions (blocks), and points inside the same block are connected with a certain probability. We demonstrate that the critical point for connectivity in this model hinges on the product of block probabilities and the size of the blocks. Lastly, we compare the critical points for connectivity in both models, finding that the geometric block model consistently yields a higher critical point than the random annulus graph. This discovery holds significant implications for designing and analyzing networked systems with a geometric foundation, such as wireless sensor networks and social networks. Altogether, this work offers valuable insights into the connectivity properties of random graphs that possess a geometric basis.",1,AI
"Recent advances in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have shown impressive performance improvements on thermal to visible face synthesis and matching problems. However, current DCNN-based synthesis models do not perform well on thermal faces with large pose variations. In order to deal with this problem, heterogeneous face frontalization methods are needed in which a model takes a thermal profile face image and generates a frontal visible face. This is an extremely difficult problem due to the large domain as well as large pose discrepancies between the two modalities. Despite its applications in biometrics and surveillance, this problem is relatively unexplored in the literature. We propose a domain agnostic learning-based generative adversarial network (DAL-GAN) which can synthesize frontal views in the visible domain from thermal faces with pose variations. DAL-GAN consists of a generator with an auxiliary classifier and two discriminators which capture both local and global texture discriminations for better synthesis. A contrastive constraint is enforced in the latent space of the generator with the help of a dual-path training strategy, which improves the feature vector discrimination. Finally, a multi-purpose loss function is utilized to guide the network in synthesizing identity preserving cross-domain frontalization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DAL-GAN can generate better quality frontal views compared to the other baseline methods.",0,Human
"Recent results by Alagic and Russell have given some evidence that the Even-Mansour cipher may be secure against quantum adversaries with quantum queries, if considered over other groups than $(\mathbb{Z}/2)^n$. This prompts the question as to whether or not other classical schemes may be generalized to arbitrary groups and whether classical results still apply to those generalized schemes. In this thesis, we generalize the Even-Mansour cipher and the Feistel cipher. We show that Even and Mansour's original notions of secrecy are obtained on a one-key, group variant of the Even-Mansour cipher. We generalize the result by Kilian and Rogaway, that the Even-Mansour cipher is pseudorandom, to super pseudorandomness, also in the one-key, group case. Using a Slide Attack we match the bound found above. After generalizing the Feistel cipher to arbitrary groups we resolve an open problem of Patel, Ramzan, and Sundaram by showing that the 3-round Feistel cipher over an arbitrary group is not super pseudorandom. We generalize a result by Gentry and Ramzan showing that the Even-Mansour cipher can be implemented using the Feistel cipher as the public permutation. In this result, we also consider the one-key case over a group and generalize their bound. Finally, we consider Zhandry's result on quantum pseudorandom permutations, showing that his result may be generalized to hold for arbitrary groups. In this regard, we consider whether certain card shuffles may be generalized as well.",0,Human
"Evolution strategies (ES) are a family of black-box optimization algorithms able to train deep neural networks roughly as well as Q-learning and policy gradient methods on challenging deep reinforcement learning (RL) problems, but are much faster (e.g. hours vs. days) because they parallelize better. However, many RL problems require directed exploration because they have reward functions that are sparse or deceptive (i.e. contain local optima), and it is unknown how to encourage such exploration with ES. Here we show that algorithms that have been invented to promote directed exploration in small-scale evolved neural networks via populations of exploring agents, specifically novelty search (NS) and quality diversity (QD) algorithms, can be hybridized with ES to improve its performance on sparse or deceptive deep RL tasks, while retaining scalability. Our experiments confirm that the resultant new algorithms, NS-ES and two QD algorithms, NSR-ES and NSRA-ES, avoid local optima encountered by ES to achieve higher performance on Atari and simulated robots learning to walk around a deceptive trap. This paper thus introduces a family of fast, scalable algorithms for reinforcement learning that are capable of directed exploration. It also adds this new family of exploration algorithms to the RL toolbox and raises the interesting possibility that analogous algorithms with multiple simultaneous paths of exploration might also combine well with existing RL algorithms outside ES.",0,Human

"This research introduces a new method for detecting cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems utilizing distributed expectation propagation (DEP). Cell-free massive MIMO holds great promise for enhancing wireless communication network efficiency, but traditional detection techniques are often resource-intensive and complex.

"The security evaluation for Mail Distribution Systems focuses on certification and reliability of sensitive data between mail servers. The need to certify the information conveyed is a result of known weaknesses in the simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP). The most important consequence of these weaknesses is the possibility to mislead the recipient, which is achieved via spam (especially email spoofing). Email spoofing refers to alterations in the headers and/or the content of the message. Therefore, the authenticity of the message is compromised. Unfortunately, the broken link between certification and reliability of the information is unsolicited email (spam).  Unlike the current practice of estimating the cost of spam, which prompts organizations to purchase and maintain appropriate anti-spam software, our approach offers an alternative perspective of the economic and moral consequences of unsolicited mail. The financial data provided in this paper show that spam is a major contributor to the financial and production cost of an organization, necessitating further attention. Additionally, this paper highlights the importance and severity of the weaknesses of the SMTP protocol, which can be exploited even with the use of simple applications incorporated within most commonly used Operating Systems (e.g. Telnet).  As a consequence of these drawbacks Mail Distribution Systems need to be appropriate configured so as to provide the necessary security services to the users.",0,Human
"In recent years, deep neural network is widely used in machine learning. The multi-class classification problem is a class of important problem in machine learning. However, in order to solve those types of multi-class classification problems effectively, the required network size should have hyper-linear growth with respect to the number of classes. Therefore, it is infeasible to solve the multi-class classification problem using deep neural network when the number of classes are huge. This paper presents a method, so called Label Mapping (LM), to solve this problem by decomposing the original classification problem to several smaller sub-problems which are solvable theoretically. Our method is an ensemble method like error-correcting output codes (ECOC), but it allows base learners to be multi-class classifiers with different number of class labels. We propose two design principles for LM, one is to maximize the number of base classifier which can separate two different classes, and the other is to keep all base learners to be independent as possible in order to reduce the redundant information. Based on these principles, two different LM algorithms are derived using number theory and information theory. Since each base learner can be trained independently, it is easy to scale our method into a large scale training system. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms the standard one-hot encoding and ECOC significantly in terms of accuracy and model complexity.",0,Human

Moreover, we see that these groups tend to disintegrate as the race continues, with each runner settling on their own pace and strategy. These insights provide valuable understanding of group behaviors in endurance events and can inform the planning of race layouts and training regimens.",1,AI
"This paper investigates how to realize better and more efficient embedding learning to tackle the semi-supervised video object segmentation under challenging multi-object scenarios. The state-of-the-art methods learn to decode features with a single positive object and thus have to match and segment each target separately under multi-object scenarios, consuming multiple times computing resources. To solve the problem, we propose an Associating Objects with Transformers (AOT) approach to match and decode multiple objects uniformly. In detail, AOT employs an identification mechanism to associate multiple targets into the same high-dimensional embedding space. Thus, we can simultaneously process multiple objects' matching and segmentation decoding as efficiently as processing a single object. For sufficiently modeling multi-object association, a Long Short-Term Transformer is designed for constructing hierarchical matching and propagation. We conduct extensive experiments on both multi-object and single-object benchmarks to examine AOT variant networks with different complexities. Particularly, our R50-AOT-L outperforms all the state-of-the-art competitors on three popular benchmarks, i.e., YouTube-VOS (84.1% J&F), DAVIS 2017 (84.9%), and DAVIS 2016 (91.1%), while keeping more than $3\times$ faster multi-object run-time.

"Several recent studies in privacy-preserving learning have considered the trade-off between utility or risk and the level of differential privacy guaranteed by mechanisms for statistical query processing. In this paper we study this trade-off in private Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning. We present two efficient mechanisms, one for the case of finite-dimensional feature mappings and one for potentially infinite-dimensional feature mappings with translation-invariant kernels. For the case of translation-invariant kernels, the proposed mechanism minimizes regularized empirical risk in a random Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space whose kernel uniformly approximates the desired kernel with high probability. This technique, borrowed from large-scale learning, allows the mechanism to respond with a finite encoding of the classifier, even when the function class is of infinite VC dimension. Differential privacy is established using a proof technique from algorithmic stability. Utility--the mechanism's response function is pointwise epsilon-close to non-private SVM with probability 1-delta--is proven by appealing to the smoothness of regularized empirical risk minimization with respect to small perturbations to the feature mapping. We conclude with a lower bound on the optimal differential privacy of the SVM. This negative result states that for any delta, no mechanism can be simultaneously (epsilon,delta)-useful and beta-differentially private for small epsilon and small beta.",0,Human
"Background: The learning of genotype-phenotype associations and history of human disease by doing detailed and precise analysis of phenotypic abnormalities can be defined as deep phenotyping. To understand and detect this interaction between phenotype and genotype is a fundamental step when translating precision medicine to clinical practice. The recent advances in the field of machine learning is efficient to predict these interactions between abnormal human phenotypes and genes.  Methods: In this study, we developed a framework to predict links between human phenotype ontology (HPO) and genes. The annotation data from the heterogeneous knowledge resources i.e., orphanet, is used to parse human phenotype-gene associations. To generate the embeddings for the nodes (HPO & genes), an algorithm called node2vec was used. It performs node sampling on this graph based on random walks, then learns features over these sampled nodes to generate embeddings. These embeddings were used to perform the downstream task to predict the presence of the link between these nodes using 5 different supervised machine learning algorithms.  Results: The downstream link prediction task shows that the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree based model (LightGBM) achieved an optimal AUROC 0.904 and AUCPR 0.784. In addition, LightGBM achieved an optimal weighted F1 score of 0.87.
