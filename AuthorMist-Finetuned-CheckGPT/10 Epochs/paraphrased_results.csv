"This paper proposes a novel method for representative selection in big data using a combination of sparse graph and geodesic Grassmann manifold distance. The goal of representative selection is to identify a small subset of data points that capture the essential characteristics of the larger dataset, making it possible to analyze and draw conclusions from the data more efficiently. The proposed method first constructs a sparse graph from the data, where each data point is a node in the graph and the edges represent the pairwise similarity between data points. Then, it uses a graph clustering algorithm to identify clusters of highly similar data points. Next, it selects a representative from each cluster by computing the geodesic Grassmann manifold distance between each pair of data points and selecting the point that is closest to the mean of the cluster in the Grassmann manifold. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments on several real-world datasets. The results show that the method outperforms several existing representative selection methods in terms of both representativeness and efficiency. The proposed method can be used in a variety of applications, such as data summarization, visualization, and classification, where representative selection is a critical step in the analysis of large datasets.","This paper introduces a new way of choosing representatives from large amounts of data using a combination of sparse graphs and geodesic distances on Grassmann manifolds. The main aim is to select a small subset of representative samples that reflect the essence of the whole dataset. To do this, we start by constructing a sparse graph from the data where nodes are data points and edges denote similarity between pairs of points. We then use clustering algorithms to find groups of closely related data points. Finally, we choose a representative element from each group by computing geodesic distances on the Grassmann manifold and picking the one closest to the mean of the group. Results show that our method works better than others in terms of both representing and efficiency. We expect this method to be useful in many tasks like summarizing data, visualizing and classifying large data sets where choosing good representatives is important."

"This paper proposes a hybrid inference system for improved curvature estimation in the level-set method using machine learning. The level-set method is a widely used technique for shape modeling and image segmentation in various fields such as computer vision, medical imaging, and graphics. The method relies on the accurate estimation of the curvature of the evolving interface, which is essential for the accurate propagation of the level-set function. However, traditional methods for curvature estimation suffer from limitations such as sensitivity to noise and uneven sampling. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid inference system that combines the traditional curvature estimation method with a machine learning-based approach.

"This paper explores the use of the Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF) and Entropic Differences (ED) metrics for high frame rate (HFR) video quality assessment. With the increasing popularity of HFR video, it is essential to have reliable methods for evaluating the visual quality of these videos. The VMAF and ED metrics have been extensively used in video quality assessment for traditional frame rates, but their performance for HFR video has not been thoroughly studied.

"This paper presents a quantitative analysis of cryptocurrency egalitarianism, exploring how the distribution of cryptocurrency holdings among users reflects or diverges from principles of egalitarianism. To do so, we analyzed transaction data from a sample of the most widely used cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.

"This paper examines the effectiveness of two common heuristics for solving vehicle routing problems (VRPs): sequence optimization and set optimization. Sequence optimization involves optimizing the order in which customers are visited by each vehicle, while set optimization involves partitioning the set of customers into clusters that are visited by different vehicles.

"This paper explores the prevalence and functional roles of heterogeneous network motifs in complex systems. Network motifs are recurring patterns of interconnections between nodes in a network, and they have been extensively studied in the context of homogeneous motifs where all nodes in the motif have the same functional role. However, many real-world networks are heterogeneous, with nodes having different functional roles and properties. In this paper, we introduce a method for identifying heterogeneous motifs in networks and analyze their prevalence across a range of real-world systems, including biological, social, and technological networks. Our analysis reveals that heterogeneous motifs are significantly more prevalent than homogeneous motifs in many real-world systems, and they play important functional roles in information processing and regulation. We find that many heterogeneous motifs are involved in modular organization, signal propagation, and regulatory feedback loops. Moreover, we demonstrate that the same heterogeneous motifs can be found in multiple systems, suggesting that they represent fundamental building blocks of complex networks. Our findings have important implications for the design and understanding of complex systems. By considering the functional roles of heterogeneous motifs, we can gain insights into the mechanisms that underlie the behavior of real-world systems, and develop more effective strategies for controlling and manipulating these systems.

"Temporal pattern mining is a crucial task in many fields such as finance, health, and engineering, where large amounts of time series data are generated regularly. Traditional methods of temporal pattern mining are inefficient and may lead to high computational costs when dealing with big time series data. Mutual information has been widely used in various fields to measure the dependence between two variables, and it has been shown to be effective in reducing the dimensionality of data.

"With the increasing demand for high-speed connectivity and mobile network coverage, drone-mounted base stations have emerged as a promising solution to enhance network coverage in remote and disaster-stricken areas. However, handover management, which refers to the process of transferring a user's connection from one base station to another, remains a critical issue for drone-mounted base stations due to their high mobility and limited coverage. In this paper, we propose a group handover strategy for drone-mounted base stations in mobile networks. The proposed group handover strategy aims to minimize the handover latency and ensure seamless connectivity for multiple users when the drone-mounted base station is in motion.

The results show that the proposed strategy can reduce the handover latency by up to 50% compared to the traditional reactive handover approach. Moreover, the proposed strategy can improve the overall network throughput and reduce the number of handover failures. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed group handover strategy for drone-mounted base stations in mobile networks. The proposed strategy can enhance the quality of service and provide seamless connectivity for users in areas with limited network coverage. Further research can explore the integration of the proposed strategy with other handover management techniques and evaluate its performance in different deployment scenarios.","With growing need for fast connections and good mobile network coverage, drones equipped with base stations are becoming promising means to improve coverage in remote and disaster areas.

However, achieving coordination in such swarms is challenging due to the inherent complexity of the system and the lack of a centralized control mechanism. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning approach to learn coordination policies for robotic swarms. Our approach involves using a centralized critic and decentralized actors to learn the coordination policies. The centralized critic observes the global state of the swarm and provides feedback to the decentralized actors, which take local actions based on their observations of the local environment. The feedback from the centralized critic is used to update the policy parameters for the decentralized actors, which gradually learn to coordinate their actions with those of the other robots in the swarm. We evaluate our approach on a set of benchmark tasks for robotic swarms, including formation control, obstacle avoidance, and cooperative transport. Our results show that our approach is effective at learning coordination policies for robotic swarms, achieving high performance on these tasks while also being able to generalize to new environments. Overall, our work demonstrates the potential of reinforcement learning for learning coordination policies in robotic swarms, and provides a foundation for further research in this area. The ability to learn coordination policies in this way could enable the development of more sophisticated and efficient robotic swarms that can accomplish complex tasks in a variety of environments.","This paper studies coordination policies learned by robot swarms.

"This paper examines the ethical debate surrounding actuarial risk assessment and the use of interventions to modify predicted outcomes. The traditional view of actuarial risk assessment has been to use predictive algorithms to identify individuals at high risk for negative outcomes and allocate resources accordingly. However, this approach raises ethical concerns about the potential for discrimination and unequal treatment. The paper argues that reframing the debate to focus on interventions rather than predictions can shift the conversation towards a more ethical and equitable approach to actuarial risk assessment. The authors propose that interventions should be designed to address the root causes of risk and promote positive outcomes, rather than simply mitigating predicted negative outcomes. The paper concludes by highlighting the importance of considering the ethical implications of actuarial risk assessment and the need for ongoing dialogue about the appropriate use of interventions in this field.","This paper looks into ethical debates over actuarial risk assessment and using interventions to change forecasted results. Traditionally, actuarial assessment uses predictive algorithms to find people who are likely to have bad results and then allocates resources accordingly. But this practice raises ethical questions about possible discrimination and unfair treatment. The paper suggests refocusing the discussion toward interventions instead of just prediction as a way to move toward a fairer approach to assessing risk through actuarial means. Interventions should target the underlying causes of risk and enhance positive results rather than just reducing forecasted negatives. In conclusion, the paper stresses that consideration of ethics is important when assessing risk via actuarial means and that there needs to be ongoing dialogue about appropriate use of interventions in this area."

"The theory of matchings in set families has been an active area of research since the seminal work of Erdős and Kleitman in 1971. In this paper, we investigate two fundamental problems in this area: the maximum matching problem and the maximal matching problem. The maximum matching problem seeks to find a matching of maximum cardinality in a given set family. We provide a new algorithm that achieves an improved upper bound on the number of edges in the matching, which improves upon the previously best-known bounds. Our algorithm also has the advantage of being faster than existing algorithms, making it practical for larger set families. The maximal matching problem seeks to find a matching that cannot be extended to a larger matching. We show that this problem is closely related to the combinatorial structure of set families and introduce a new measure called the maximal matching degree. Using this measure, we prove a new upper bound on the maximal matching degree, which has implications for the existence of maximal matchings in certain classes of set families. Our results extend the work of Erdős and Kleitman and shed new light on the structure of matchings in set families. They have implications for a variety of applications in computer science, operations research, and other fields.","Since important work by Erdos and Kleitman in 1971, research has continued into the theory of matchings in set families.

"In recent years, there has been growing interest in the study of computational complexity of various variants of combinatorial voter control problems in elections. Combinatorial voter control refers to the problem of manipulating the outcome of an election by making strategic changes to the votes of a subset of voters. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the computational complexity of several variants of this problem. First, we consider the classic voter control problem, where the goal is to make a minimum number of vote changes to ensure a desired candidate wins the election. We show that this problem is NP-hard, meaning that finding the optimal solution is computationally infeasible for large instances of the problem. Next, we explore the complexity of variants of this problem that take into account constraints such as budget limitations or restrictions on the number of vote changes that can be made to a single voter. We show that these variants are also NP-hard, and provide algorithms for finding approximate solutions to these problems. Finally, we consider the computational complexity of the voter control problem under different election systems, including single-winner elections, multi-winner elections, and proportional representation elections. We show that the complexity of the problem varies depending on the election system and provide algorithms for solving the problem under each system. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the computational complexity of various variants of combinatorial voter control problems in elections, and provides insights into the design of algorithms for solving these problems.","In recent years there has grown increasing interest in studying the computational complexity of different variants of combinatorial problems related to voting control in elections.

"Explanatory machine learning refers to the use of algorithms to understand and interpret the predictions made by machine learning models. While these algorithms can provide valuable insights into how models make decisions, they can also have harmful consequences if used improperly.

Additionally, the explanations generated by these algorithms can be misleading, leading to incorrect decisions based on incomplete or inaccurate information. The ethical implications of explanatory machine learning are significant, and it is important for practitioners to consider these implications when designing and deploying these algorithms. This paper concludes with a call for further research and discussion to ensure that the benefits of explanatory machine learning are realized while minimizing its potential harm.","Explanatory machine learning uses algorithms to explain predictions of machine learning models; both positive and negative results should be considered here.

"This paper presents a new approach to modelling epistemic uncertainty using Bayesian confidence calibration. Epistemic uncertainty arises from a lack of knowledge or understanding about a system, which can result in significant errors when making predictions.

"This paper investigates the connectivity properties of random annulus graphs and the geometric block model. These models are commonly used in network science to model real-world networks with underlying geometric structure. In particular, we focus on the critical threshold for connectivity, which is the probability at which the network transitions from being disconnected to being connected. We first introduce the random annulus graph, which is a random graph generated by connecting points in an annulus with probability determined by the Euclidean distance between the points. We prove that the critical threshold for connectivity in the random annulus graph is determined by a simple function of the parameters of the annulus. Next, we consider the geometric block model, which is a random graph generated by partitioning a d-dimensional space into blocks and connecting points within the same block with some probability. We show that the critical threshold for connectivity in the geometric block model is determined by the product of the block probabilities and the volume of the blocks. Finally, we compare the critical thresholds for connectivity in the random annulus graph and the geometric block model. We demonstrate that the critical threshold in the geometric block model is always greater than or equal to that in the random annulus graph. This result has important implications for the design and analysis of networked systems with underlying geometric structure, such as wireless sensor networks and social networks. Overall, this paper provides important insights into the connectivity properties of random graphs with underlying geometric structure.","This paper looks at connectivity properties of random annuli graphs and the geometric block model. Both these models are frequently used in network science for modeling networks that have underlying geometric structure. Specifically, we focus on determining critical threshold probabilities at which networks go from disconnected to connected. We start by introducing random annuli graphs: they consist of randomly placing points inside an annulus and connecting those points if the Euclidean distance between them meets a certain probability criterion. We prove that connectivity critical threshold depends simply on parameters of the annulus. We then consider the geometric block model: here we split a d dimensional space into blocks and connect points within the same block with a fixed probability. We show that connectivity critical threshold depends on product of block probabilities and block volume. Lastly we compare critical thresholds for connectivity of random annuli graphs and geometric block model and find that critical threshold for model based on blocks is always higher than or equal to that of the annuli graph. Results have major implications for designing and analyzing systems that include networks with embedded geometry like wireless sensor networks and social networks. Overall this work reveals key features of connectivity in random graphs having underlying geometric features."
"The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a crucial tool in a wide range of scientific and engineering applications, including signal processing, image processing, and scientific simulations. As the size of the data increases, the computational cost of computing the FFT also increases, making it necessary to develop efficient parallel algorithms for the FFT.

"This paper presents an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approach to community recovery management following a natural disaster. Traditional recovery management approaches have focused on pre-defined and static recovery plans, which may not be applicable or effective in dynamic and complex post-disaster scenarios. The proposed ADP approach is designed to learn from past disaster events and dynamically adapt recovery strategies based on the evolving state of the affected community. The ADP approach combines data-driven machine learning techniques with a dynamic optimization framework to provide adaptive decision-making capabilities for recovery management. The framework considers multiple objectives, such as minimizing recovery time, maximizing resource utilization, and minimizing costs, while accounting for the uncertainties and constraints associated with the recovery process. The ADP approach is also able to incorporate feedback from the community and recovery stakeholders, enabling the system to learn from its own performance and improve over time. To evaluate the effectiveness of the ADP approach, a case study is conducted on a hypothetical community impacted by a major earthquake. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to provide effective recovery strategies that outperform traditional static recovery plans. Moreover, the ADP approach is able to quickly adapt to changes in the community and recovery environment, enabling efficient and effective recovery management. Overall, this research highlights the potential benefits of applying ADP to community recovery management, providing decision-makers with a powerful tool to better prepare for and respond to natural disasters. The ADP approach is able to learn from past experiences, dynamically adapt to changes in the recovery environment, and effectively balance multiple recovery objectives, ultimately resulting in more resilient and sustainable communities.","This paper introduces an approach using Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) for disaster recovery management. Traditional methods typically rely on fixed and unchanging plans that do not work well in complex and changing situations after disasters occur.

The ADP approach incorporates feedback from community members and stakeholders so the system can learn and improve performance over time. Results from a case study show that the new method performs much better than traditional static recovery plans. Furthermore, ADP quickly responds to shifts in the community and recovery conditions and manages recovery efficiently and effectively. In sum, this research demonstrates the advantage of using ADP for disaster recovery management and offers policymakers strong tools to better handle natural disasters. ADP excels at adapting to past lessons learned, balancing diverse recovery objectives, and producing more resilient and sustainable communities."

"Reinforcement learning (RL) is a popular machine learning approach for decision making problems, where an agent learns from the consequences of its actions to maximize a reward signal. However, in many real-world applications, the reward signal is subject to noise or perturbations, which can lead to suboptimal or undesirable behavior. This paper presents a comprehensive study of RL with perturbed rewards, focusing on two main aspects: (1) the impact of reward perturbations on the learning process and the performance of RL algorithms, and (2) the design of robust RL algorithms that are able to handle reward perturbations effectively. The study explores different forms of reward perturbations, such as Gaussian noise, stochastic reward functions, and reward tampering attacks, and evaluates various RL algorithms, including value-based, policy-based, and actor-critic methods, under different perturbation scenarios. The results show that reward perturbations can have a significant impact on the learning process and the performance of RL algorithms, and highlight the importance of designing robust RL algorithms that can effectively handle reward perturbations. The paper provides insights and guidelines for future research in this area and has implications for a wide range of applications, including robotics, gaming, autonomous systems, and more.","Reinforcement learning (RL) is one of the most used approaches for decision making tasks; agents learn through their actions and aim to maximize the reward signals.

"This paper presents a lower bound for the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem on deterministic Turing machines. The SAT problem is a fundamental problem in computer science, which asks whether a given boolean formula can be satisfied by some assignment of truth values to its variables. The lower bound established in this paper states that any deterministic Turing machine algorithm that solves the SAT problem requires at least 2^n / poly(n) time, where n is the number of variables in the input formula and poly(n) is some polynomial function of n. To prove this lower bound, the paper introduces a novel technique for constructing hard instances of the SAT problem that require a large number of steps to solve on a Turing machine. The technique is based on the notion of ""expanding"" formulas, which involves adding redundant clauses to the formula in such a way that any satisfying assignment must satisfy a large subset of the added clauses. The paper then shows that any deterministic Turing machine algorithm for the SAT problem must spend a significant amount of time checking these redundant clauses, which leads to the lower bound. The significance of this result is that it provides a strong lower bound for the SAT problem on deterministic Turing machines, which is a widely studied problem in theoretical computer science. The lower bound implies that there is a fundamental limit to the efficiency of any deterministic algorithm for solving the SAT problem, which has important implications for the design and analysis of algorithms in general. The paper concludes by discussing some potential avenues for future research based on the techniques developed in this work.",This paper establishes a lower bound for deterministic Turing machine algorithms that solve the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem. SAT is a core question in computer science asking if there exists an assignment of truth values that satisfies a given Boolean formula. This paper asserts that any deterministic Turing machine solving SAT requires at least time 2^n divided by some polynomial function p(n) of n; here n denotes the number of variables in the input formula and p(n) is some polynomial. Proving this lower bound uses a new technique for constructing hard SAT instances requiring many steps. Expanding formulas are used here: extra clauses are added redundantly so any solution must satisfy a large part of them. Showing that deterministic algorithms need to check these extra clauses very slowly proves the bound. Results are important because they set a strong lower limit for efficient deterministic solutions to SAT: this problem has been extensively studied in theoretical computer science. Lower bounds imply there is a fundamental barrier to efficiency for deterministic algorithms generally. Concluding remarks discuss further research directions suggested by this work.
"In this paper, we present a parallel implementation of the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) based on a modified Cholesky decomposition. The EnKF is a popular data assimilation method that uses a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the state of a complex dynamic system. However, its implementation can be computationally expensive, especially for large-scale problems. To address this issue, we propose a parallel implementation of the EnKF that leverages the modified Cholesky decomposition to distribute the computation across multiple processors. The modified Cholesky decomposition is a matrix factorization method that provides an efficient way to compute the square root of a positive-definite matrix. By using this technique, our parallel implementation of the EnKF is able to significantly reduce the computation time without sacrificing accuracy. The performance of the parallel implementation is evaluated using numerical experiments, and the results show that it is able to achieve substantial speed-ups compared to a sequential implementation of the EnKF. This work has implications for a wide range of applications, including weather forecasting, climate modeling, and seismic imaging, where the EnKF is used to process large amounts of data in real-time.","We present here an implementation of Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) parallelized through use of a modified Cholesky decomposition.
